<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, July 8 at 2 p.m., the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory.</p>

<p>All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,306 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20 and our last case recovered on May 1.</p>

<p>We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected.</p>

<p><strong>Weekday updates</strong></p>

<p>We update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca, except public holidays. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered.</p>

<p><strong>Respiratory Assessment Centre reopens</strong></p>

<p>In anticipation of the demand for increased testing as a result of opening Yukon’s borders and in preparation for influenza season, the stand alone respiratory assessment centre reopened on Monday, July 6. The new location is 49A Waterfront Place in Whitehorse and the hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. People will still require a referral from 811 Yukon HealthLine, a family physician, community health nurse or Whitehorse General Hospital and can arrange a time for testing by calling 867-393-3083.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital changes visiting policy</strong></p>

<p>Effective July 6, Whitehorse General Hospital changed its visiting policy. All admitted patients are now allowed one designated, and consistent, visitor. All maternity, Emergency Room (ER) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients will continue to be permitted one designated visitor or support person.</p>

<p>Patients and clients checking in for blood work, imaging exams, physio or occupational therapy and specialists appointments will not be permitted a support person except in limited circumstances.</p>

<p>Screeners will remain in place at all public entrances and will ask about travel history and heath symptoms. Questions about hospital policies or services during the COVID-19 pandemic can be directed to to 867-393-9040. This number is not for medical advice or support.</p>

<p><strong>Visitor Information Centres open</strong></p>

<p>Five of Yukon’s visitor information centres are now open. The visitor information centres in Whitehorse, Carcross, Dawson City and Beaver Creek opened on July 1 and the Watson Lake centre opened on July 5.</p>

<p>Visitors are being provided with the most up to date information from Yukon.ca as well as Council for Yukon First Nations' communities site. Visitor information centre staff are advising travellers to check to make sure that communities are receptive to visitors and providing reminders for people to visit respectfully. The advice applies to visitors from outside Yukon and Yukon residents who may be taking a “staycation” this year. Visit <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/borders-and-travel-covid-19/travel-within-yukon-communities">Travel to Yukon communities guidelines: COVID-19</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Six steps to staying safe  </strong></p>

<p>The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.</p>

<p><strong>Latest information</strong></p>

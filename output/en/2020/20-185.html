<p>The Government of Yukon and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health released more details today on Phase 2 of Yukon’s plan for safely lifting COVID-19 public health measures. Phase 2 will begin July 1 and includes significant changes to border control measures.</p>

<p>Beginning tomorrow, residents of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter Yukon without having to self-isolate. To do so, they must provide valid identification proving they are a resident of one of those four jurisdictions and declare they have not travelled outside of those locations in the previous 14 days.</p>

<p>Yukon’s borders will also open to the rest of Canada starting tomorrow, but with strict public health measures in place, including the need to self-isolate for 14-days. Some Canadian residents may be exempt from the self-isolation requirement, such as critical workers and individuals transiting through Yukon.</p>

<p>Enforcement officers will continue to be stationed at Yukon border checkpoints to advise travellers of their obligation to self-isolate, and provide information on how to safely transit through Yukon.</p>

<p>The transition to Phase 2 is made possible by the continued downward trend in COVID-19 cases nationally and enhanced health care capacity locally. The start of Phase 2 is also supported by new and revised sector-specific guidelines for businesses and restaurants, vulnerable populations and many more. A complete listing of all published guidelines and recommendations related to staying safe or operating a business in the territory during COVID-19 can be found by visiting <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/operating-guidelines-covid-19">Yukon.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the precautions taken by Yukoners over the course of the pandemic so far, we are in a position to enter Phase II of our Path Forward plan and continue to lift restrictions. Our goal as a government remains to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Yukon and to protect the health and safety of Yukoners. We have published dozens of guidelines and recommendations so businesses, organizations, and all Yukoners know how to operate safely during the pandemic. We are confident in the measures we have in place to protect our most vulnerable citizens and also know Yukoners will continue to do their part by practising the Safe Six.</p>

<p>Tomorrow brings a new challenge for all of us; to adapt to a world where, COVID-19 is a fact of daily life. Since the gates shut in March we have been able to fend off outbreaks and kept the numbers of cases to a minimum. We have kept our seniors and our vulnerable populations safe. We were able to take the time to learn about COVID-19, learn from others and prepare our defences. I am confident we are prepared to meet this new challenge of living with COVID-19 while progressively restoring our overall health.</p>

        <p>As of July 1, residents of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter Yukon without having to self-isolate if they can provide ID proving their residency, and confirm they have not been outside those four jurisdictions in the past 14 days.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>These jurisdictions have implemented public health measures that have shown good results in stemming the spread of COVID-19. The self-isolation exemption list can change based on COVID-19 case counts, outbreaks, and risk mitigation measures.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>As of July 1, all remaining residents of Canada may enter Yukon as long as they self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. Some may be exempt from the self-isolation requirement, such as critical workers and individuals transiting through Yukon.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments are identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The Safe Six are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 indoors and 50 outdoors; limiting travel to rural communities and being respectful when you’re there; and self-isolating if you’ve just returned to Yukon from anywhere other than British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.</p>

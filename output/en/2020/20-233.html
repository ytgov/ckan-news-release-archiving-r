<p>Biographies of 2020 Outstanding Youth Achievement Award recipients</p>

<p><strong>Vanessa Oliverio</strong></p>

<p>Vanessa, 18, is being recognized for her devotion to the youth and community of Dawson. She is a staple in community events and with the Dawson City volunteer firefighters. As a junior volunteer firefighter, Vanessa can often be found promoting fire safety to both youth and adults alike. She is also an advocate for climate change action, mental health, Indigenous rights and youth engagement. She recently arranged a youth trip to Old Crow which she has since documented in a photobook. Vanessa volunteers with the Students Commission of Canada promoting issues such as mental health and climate change awareness in the North. In addition to her community outreach, Vanessa has won both the Air North First Light and Skills Canada Photo competitions.</p>

<p><strong>Taylor Shorty</strong></p>

<p>Taylor, 16, is being recognized for his volunteer work and mentorship within his hometown of Faro. Taylor has represented Yukon in golf at the Western Canada Summer Games and has volunteered his time teaching at the Faro Golf Course. His dedication to volunteering at community events has made him a mentor and role model for youth and adults alike. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Taylor taught the youth of Faro snowmobile safety so they could serve the community by running errands and other helpful activities. Taylor’s contributions to sport, community engagement and youth programming help make Faro a better place for its youth and other community members.</p>

<p><strong>Max Zimmermann</strong></p>

<p>Max, 16, is being recognized for his volunteer work as a basketball coach and member of the F.H. Collins Social Justice Club. Max is involved with many initiatives including a national climate change project that aims to reduce waste in Yukon lakes by installing receptacles for discarded fishing lines. Max is also the host of a youth video series through the Yukon Child and Youth Advocate Office focusing on the voices of local youth with the lens of the United Nations convention on child rights. Max is an outstanding role model for his peers and youth in Whitehorse, encouraging them to participate in an active lifestyle and teaching them the importance of giving to others.</p>

<p><strong>Judy Russell</strong></p>

<p>Judy, 17, is being recognized for her commitment to being a leader and role model for her school community, as well as Yukon athletics. Judy used her high personal academic achievement to help others as a peer tutor in a variety of subjects. In addition to tutoring, taking a full class load and overcoming personal difficulties, Judy learned to play five instruments, often taking time to mentor younger students to become more comfortable and confident with their own musicianship. Judy is also being recognized for her contribution to Yukon Wrestling. Judy has competed and medalled for Team Yukon at the Arctic Winter Games, Western Canada Summer Games and the Inuit Games. When an injury prevented Judy from competing for a season, she earned her Coaching Level 1, encouraging younger wrestlers to achieve their personal best.</p>

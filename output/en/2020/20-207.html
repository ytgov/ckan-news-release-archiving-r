<p>Fifteen community-led projects focused on crime prevention and services for victims are receiving $297,241 in funding from the Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust (CPVST).</p>

<p>Projects include supporting youth leadership; education surrounding trauma and healing, music and dance; mental health workshops; cultural events and workshops for marginalized women; traditional workshops; domestic violence and abuse programming; attention regulation supports and supporting healthy activities for children, families and youth.</p>

<p>Organizations have adapted their plans in order to continue to work throughout the territory with the current COVID-19 restrictions.  Projects funded in the fall have adjusted their delivery and sought extensions in order to continue providing Yukoners with ways to reduce crime and provide services for victims. </p>

<p>The CPVST Board of Trustees awarded $242,535 to projects with a crime prevention focus and $54,706 to projects providing services and support to victims of crime. The next application deadline is 11:59 p.m. on August 18, 2020. The CPVST reminds organizations that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how some services are offered for victims and applicants are encouraged to be creative with how projects will run in these unparalleled times.</p>

<p><strong>Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in</strong> was awarded $13,100 for First Fish Camp. This camp was held last fall during the salmon run at Moosehide village, near Dawson City, allowing youth to be on the land for one week learning about salmon harvesting, processing, conservation, traditional medicines, foods and languages, as well as discussing traditional justice and what it looks like in a modern community.  Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in members and elders also attended to provide guidance, teachings, stories and history. </p>

<p><strong>The Village of Teslin</strong> was awarded $14,547 for the Teslin Summer Program. This project focuses on keeping youth busy over the summer with meaningful recreation by offering a variety of summer camps and workshops from July to September, aimed at physical activity, personal growth skills, participation in land-based camps, while providing healthy snacks to youth to emphasize proper nutrition.  Original summer plans required revision due to COVID-19 restrictions in regards to travel and social distancing.

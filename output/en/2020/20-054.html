<p>After careful consideration and out of an abundance of caution, I will not be attending the First Ministers’ Meeting this week. Prior to making this decision I took into account the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) and my attendance at the Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual conference earlier this month.<br><br>
	The risk for COVID-19 in Yukon and Canada remains low and Yukon’s medical system is well prepared for this situation.<br><br>
	In making this decision, the CMOH and I considered what might happen if I needed to self-isolate outside of the Yukon and the impacts that would have. At this time, I feel my efforts are needed here at home.<br><br>
	Obviously, this is an extremely rare situation and this is a precautionary measure. We see great value in these meetings and merit in attending. Today I spoke directly with the Prime Minister and am confident Yukon priorities will be shared at the meeting.<br><br>
	Also out of an abundance of caution following today’s announcement about the case at PDAC, Minister Pillai is being tested for COVID-19 and will self-isolate until the results are clear. I understand that the Public Service Commission is also reaching out to employees who attended this event to share relevant information.<br><br>
	Yukoners, I urge you to remain calm and to follow the advice of credible medical professionals. Yukon’s CMOH has been providing updates on the virus and is sharing these through local media and the Yukon.ca website as well as the CMOH site.<br><br>
	The most clear and constant advice about this virus is to remain vigilant. Wash your hands, cover your mouth if you cough, disinfect objects you touch frequently, avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are not feeling well.<br><br>
	If you are presenting with symptoms, contact a health provider through 811.</p>

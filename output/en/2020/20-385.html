<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of today, December 17, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 59. Fifty-seven people have recovered, one person has died, and there is currently one active case. We have tested 5,790 people.</p>

<h3>Social bubble guidelines: COVID-19</h3>

<p>As COVID-19 continues in Yukon and the holiday season approaches, we’re asking Yukoners to be careful and respect gathering guidelines and stick to their social bubbles.</p>

<p>Your social bubble can include up to 15 people, but the smaller your bubble, the smaller the risk of being exposed to COVID-19. We encourage you to reduce your bubble to fewer than 10 where possible. Don’t forget, indoor gatherings are limited to 10 people. If you gather with anyone who’s not in your social bubble, you must keep a two-metre (six feet) distance from them at all times.</p>

<p>More information on the social bubble guidelines is available at: <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/industry-operating-guidelines-covid-19/combined-household-guidelines-covid-19&amp;nbsp">https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/industry-o…</a>;</p>

<h3>Automatic text upon entry in Yukon</h3>

<p>As of Monday, December 14, every person who signed a declaration when they entered Yukon will receive a text message approximately 72 hours after their arrival. This text message is a reminder of their obligation to self-isolate upon arrival in Yukon and provides a link to Yukon.ca for information and resources. The message is sent in both English and French.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre</h3>

<p>From Monday, December 7, to Wednesday, December 16, we tested 201 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) and drive-thru testing locations in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>The drive-thru COVID-19 testing centre remains open with reduced hours. It’s now open Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., at the same location.</p>

<h3>Contact information for restaurant and bar customers</h3>

<p>Since December 7, restaurants and bars have been collecting their customers’ contact information in case we need to do contact tracing. We recommend that businesses collect last as well as first names of customers and, for confidentiality purposes, make sure information isn’t accessible to any other customers.</p>

<p>We recommend that businesses collect:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first and last name and telephone number or email address of at least one member of every party;</li>
	<li>the total number in the group;</li>
	<li>the date and time of entry; and</li>
	<li>the table number or location.</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate the steps restaurants and bars are taking to help stop the spread of infection.</p>

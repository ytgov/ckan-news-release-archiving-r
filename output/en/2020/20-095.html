<p>The Government of Yukon’s Minister of Education, Tracy-Anne McPhee, has suspended face-to-face classes for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year, on the recommendation of Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.</p>

<p>Student learning will continue through alternative learning opportunities starting on April 16 for the remainder of the school year. Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements have been developed and shared with Yukon schools to inform plans for at-home learning throughout the territory. The Department of Education worked with the British Columbia Ministry of Education and a committee of educators and central administration staff to develop the new requirements.</p>

<p>School principals and teachers are using these requirements to identify essential learning that needs to be covered for the remainder of the school year, develop learning plans to ensure continued learning and communicate with students and families. Schools are currently planning how to deliver at-home student learning with traditional and online resources.</p>

<p>Learning plans are being tailored to the unique needs of each individual school community and will incorporate a variety of ways to provide learning opportunities, including for families who may not have access to technology. These plans may look different in each Yukon school.</p>

<p>Each school will work with families before April 15 on how they will deliver at-home learning and complete the most essential learning starting April 16 through the remainder of the school year.</p>

<p>The health and safety of students, staff and communities is our first priority. The dedicated staff in Yukon schools are working diligently to adapt and ensure student learning continues during this unprecedented time. I want to acknowledge and thank the educators, principals and central administration staff for all their efforts to support student learning. I also want to thank and acknowledge the efforts of students, parents and families for their patience and understanding as we all adjust to new realities. Together we will continue to meet the learning needs of Yukon students.</p>

<p>I have worked closely with the Department of Education to reach the best decision for the protection of students and staff. Learning and health will always be partners. Even as face to face classes are suspended, the learning will continue.  It will be challenging for all, for teachers, students and parents and guardians, but by taking this step now, we are protecting the future.</p>

<p><em>Please note that testing dates in the Respiratory Assessment Centre have been updated, and we have added a clarification to the "Other approved jurisdictions" category</em>.<em> </em></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, September 2, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 2,643 people.</p>

<p><strong>Respiratory Assessment Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Wednesday, August 26, to Tuesday, September 1, we tested 109 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse.</p>

<p><strong>Yukon Business Relief Program</strong></p>

<p>This Yukon Business Relief Program will continue in partnership with CanNor’s Northern Business Relief Fund. Businesses can apply for support for both or either of these programs through the Government of Yukon.</p>

<p><strong>Community Wellbeing Survey</strong></p>

<p>The territory-wide Community Wellbeing Survey is closing on September 6. The results of the survey will provide a territory-wide snapshot of Yukoners’ wellbeing and generate needed data to support informed decision making. The COVID-specific questions at the start of the survey will be used to inform next steps in the pandemic response. Visit yukon.ca for more information.</p>

<p><strong>International border reminder</strong></p>

<p>This section has been updated to clarify when Yukoners are required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Yukoners are reminded that if you choose to go past the Canadian border station at Fraser or Beaver Creek, you must be aware of the federal rules for re-entering Canada at the time of your departure. If you cross into Alaska, you will be subject to these federal rules, which include a mandatory 14-day quarantine. These rules are applied equally at all official border crossings (and points of international arrivals) across Canada, and you must follow the directions given to you by the CBSA and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<p>The federal requirements are separate from our own territorial border measures. For example, as a Yukoner, you are required to self-isolate if you've travelled outside of Yukon, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories or Nunavut.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>

<p><strong>Yukoners encouraged to remain vigilant </strong></p>

<p>Although there are no confirmed active cases in the territory, Yukoners are encouraged to remain vigilant and continue following the Safe 6:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol.</li>
	<li>Stay home if you're feeling sick.</li>
	<li>Remember to keep two metres (six feet) between yourself and people who are not in your social bubble.</li>
	<li>Limit travel to rural communities and be respectful when you’re there.</li>
	<li>Self-isolate if you’ve:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>just returned to Yukon and have been outside of British Columbia, Nunavut or the Northwest Territories in the last 14 days; or</li>
			<li>been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.</li>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enforcement statistics</strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has received 726 complaints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to self-isolate: 401</li>
	<li>Social gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 22</li>
	<li>Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on the designated route: 283</li>
	<li>Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 7</li>
	<li>Failure to abide by a declaration form or not permitted entry into Yukon: 11</li>
	<li>Other: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been six charges laid under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA).</p>

<p>A total of 40,070 travellers have come into Yukon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resident travellers: 7,710</li>
	<li>BC residents: 6,375</li>
	<li>NWT residents: 194</li>
	<li>Other approved jurisdictions: 518*</li>
	<li>Non-residents staying: 8,562</li>
	<li>Non-residents transiting: 16,673</li>
	<li>Other: 38</li>
	<li>Decals distributed indicating out-of-territory vehicles allowed in Yukon: 243</li>
</ul>
<p>* Due to the fact that the way we’ve collected traveller data has changed since we started collecting statistics, the "Other approved jurisdictions" category has been used to categorize travellers that did not fall into an existing category. We’re reviewing how we collect and categorize statistics to maintain accuracy, and will make adjustments as necessary.</p>

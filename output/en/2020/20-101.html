<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, April 14, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon remains at eight with seven cases in Whitehorse and one in a community.</p>

<p>Six of the eight people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital.</p>

<p>Each case in Yukon so far can be traced to its origin and there continues to be no known community transmission in the territory. Community transmission is presumed to occur when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected.</p>

<p>Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered.</p>

<p><strong>Easter success</strong></p>

<p>Yukoners are thanked for following the pandemic orders and recommendations over the Easter weekend and staying close to home, staying safe and not putting unnecessary pressure on medical and emergency services.</p>

<p><strong>Six steps to staying safe</strong></p>

<p>Although community transmission is not known to have reached the territory yet, it is possible that it has already arrived. This is why the public should continue to act to limit potential infection. By following six steps to staying safe, Yukoners will help to stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<ol>
<li>Practise physical distancing – keep two metres or six feet away from everyone who’s not in your household.</li>
	<li>Wash your hands frequently.</li>
	<li>Stay home when you’re sick.</li>
	<li>Don’t gather in groups of 10 or more people.</li>
	<li>Don’t travel to communities unless it’s essential.</li>
	<li>Self-isolate when you’re required to – either because you’ve travelled into the territory or because you are a contact of someone diagnosed with or being investigated for COVID-19.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Doctor appointments and immunizations</strong></p>

<p>People who would normally be visiting health centres for immunizations should carry on doing so despite the pandemic. Those with ailments or conditions not related to COVID-19 should call their doctors for appointments in the usual way. They will be able to talk to their doctor by phone and their doctor will determine whether they need a face to face appointment.</p>

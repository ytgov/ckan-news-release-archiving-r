<p>The Government of Yukon and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health officially announced today that Phase 3 of Yukon’s plan for safely lifting COVID-19 public health measures will begin on August 1. This will be the longest of the stages, lasting until a vaccine is developed, and will involve a gradual easing of restrictions for Yukoners.</p>

<p>Starting on August 1, Yukoners can increase their household bubble from one additional family by adding three to five families depending on family size. The maximum number of individuals in a bubble should be 15 people. Members of this bubble can interact without having to physically distance.  </p>

<p>Indoor social gatherings remain limited to 10 with social distancing, unless it is with people that are part of your social bubble. Outdoor gatherings remain at 50. However, Phase 3 allows for planned, seated events in rented spaces with a maximum of 50 people as long the rules of the rental venue are followed. Seated outdoor events with 100 people, such as weddings, will also be allowed.</p>

<p>Yukon athletes will be able to return to play as part of Phase 3. Officials with the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s office will meet with sports organizations and officials to plan a safe return to sports activities this fall. More details will be shared as they become available.</p>

<p>The transition to Phase 3 is enabled through meeting the indicators outlined in A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for safely lifting COVID-19 restrictions. The Government of Yukon, based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to evaluate the overall risk to Yukoners when determining when to further ease restrictions throughout Phase 3, including travel restrictions.</p>

<p>We are on track to enter Phase 3 of our Path Forward plan on August 1. This would not have been possible without the incredible effort from Yukoners who are doing their part to take precautions to protect themselves and their friends, families and neighbours. I strongly urge all Yukoners to continue to practice the six steps to staying safe. Our government will continue to take a measured approach to lifting restrictions in Yukon, based on advice from Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.</p>

<p>Our community actions have helped us get to where we are able to enter Phase 3 on August 1. This will be a long phase and we will continue to move slowly. With continued support from citizens and continued adherence to the Safe Six, we will be able to keep moving forward towards our new normal. As we open up and gather more, adhering to the Safe Six is more important than ever.</p>

        <p>There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon’s case count is at 14, which include Yukoners who contracted the virus outside of the territory. All 11 cases of COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered.</p>

        <p>Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments are identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.</p>

        <p>The Safe Six are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 indoors and 50 outdoors; limiting travel to rural communities and being respectful when you’re there; and self-isolating if you’ve just returned to Yukon from anywhere other than BC, Nunavut and NWT.</p>

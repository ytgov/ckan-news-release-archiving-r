<p>The Government of Yukon today announced economic supports related to COVID-19.</p>

<p>A new rebate program for Yukon employers to benefit workers and self-employed individuals in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19 was announced by Minister Pillai today.</p>

<p>The Paid Sick Leave Program allows Yukon workers or those self-employed who are without sick leave to stay at home if they are sick and required to self-isolate for 14 days and still meet their basic financial needs. All eligible Yukon employers and self-employed individuals may apply.</p>

<p>Minister Pillai also announced temporary changes to the Yukon Nominee Program during the COVID-19 public health emergency.</p>

<p>Yukon nominees who experience lay offs or reduced work hours will not be issued the standard 90-day notice to find new employment.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is taking a comprehensive approach to supporting Yukon businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19. We are working with all stakeholders, including the Government of Canada, to assess the economic impacts and support our economy.</p>

<p>The Paid Sick Leave Program and changes to the Yukon Nominee Program will help Yukon businesses and workers during these challenging times. These changes are critical in our efforts to keep Yukoners healthy and are only one part of a series of measures our government is implementing to support Yukon’s economy. We want to relieve as much worry as possible for Yukoners during this already stressful and uncertain time.</p>

<p>Yukon’s licensed child care centres and family day homes will receive additional funding to provide care to children during the COVID-19 response and beyond it. The Government of Yukon will cover staff wages as well as eligible building expenses, including rent, utilities and cleaning costs. The funding will support child care operators and enable them to avoid charging parent fees as Yukon responds to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>If a child care centre remains open, the Direct Operating Grant will provide 100 per cent of eligible building costs for March, April, May and June 2020, as well as wages for all working staff, including the employer’s contribution for Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan and the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board.</p>

<p>If a child care centre is closed, the grant will cover 100 per cent of eligible building costs for March, April, May and June 2020. Staff are encouraged to access supports from the Government of Canada.</p>

<p>If a family day home remains open, its grant will increase by 50 per cent for March, April, May and June 2020 and it will receive full funding for all established spaces regardless of whether the spaces are full.</p>

<p>If a day home is closed, the grant will suspend until it reopens. Owners are encouraged to access supports from the federal government until they can reopen.</p>

<p>Child care operators may also be eligible for additional financial support for supplies or services they require to operate during the COVID-19 response. Operators are encouraged to work with their child care inspector to determine eligibility.</p>

<p>At this time, parents and guardians who typically rely on child care services are asked to keep their children at home if possible. Parents who are working from home should keep their children with them. This will make spaces available for people who provide essential services or who cannot work from home.</p>

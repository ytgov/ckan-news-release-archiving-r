<p>The Government of Yukon has signed a letter of intent with the BC Renal Agency to maximize opportunities for Yukoners to receive dialysis in Yukon.</p>

<p>This new partnership will increase focus on early intervention and support of independent dialysis options. A primary goal will be to work with patients early in their kidney disease process to help maintain kidney function without requiring dialysis.</p>

<p>Yukoners identified as candidates for peritoneal or home dialysis will be supported to receive training in B.C., and provided with the home equipment, and where necessary, home supports to ensure a positive outcome.</p>

<p>A review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health recommends independent, home-based dialysis as the preferred first option for patients requiring dialysis. Home-based dialysis is just as effective as hemodialysis provided in a hospital setting.</p>

<p><em>This release has been updated to clarify medical terminology.</em></p>

<li class="field__item">
        <p>There are approximately 61 individuals in Yukon with diagnosed chronic kidney disease. None of them currently require dialysis.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>As of October 2019, there were 10 Yukon patients on peritoneal dialysis in Yukon. There were none on home hemodialysis. That number has fluctuated between zero and two for the past six years; the peritoneal numbers have fluctuated between four and 10.<br><br>
	 </p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The Government of Yukon and BC Renal Agency are setting the framework to improve services and better support patients with kidney disease in territory. This is a first in the 30-year history of renal care delivery in the territory. </p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>This framework includes exploring early intervention, prevention and localized navigational support to help prevent progression early. These are fundamental first steps to building capacity and sustainability of renal services and optimizing outcomes for Yukoners.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>It is estimated it would cost between $2.5 and $3 million to establish an in-centre hemodialysis unit. Establishing a home dialysis program will cost less than $1 million and would permit the care of a larger number of individuals. As part of the agreement, government is working with B.C. Renal on actual costs to deliver a home dialysis program. Even with an in-centre dialysis unit, end stage kidney patients would still have to travel to B.C. or Alberta for this very specialized care.</p>

<p>Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. That is why the Government of Canada partnered with the Government of Yukon to provide additional support to hundreds of low-income households across the territory between now and 2027.</p>

<p>Today, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Ahmed Hussen, along with Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost, announced the Canada-Yukon Housing benefit, a direct to household benefit program which will help low to moderate income Yukoners in rental housing who cannot afford rent for a home that meets their needs. The program includes $9.1 million of new federal funding, combined with a mix of territorial cost matching, for a total of $18.2 million that will support affordable housing subsidies for Yukoners.</p>

<p>The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit prioritizes households in need and the tenant can continue to receive the benefit if they move to another home within the territory. Depending on their household income and size of family, applicants can receive $200, $400, $600 or $800 per month.</p>

<p>Yukoners can apply for the new benefit at Yukon Housing Corporation offices or online at <a href="https://yukon.ca/apply-Canada-Yukon-housing-benefit">https://yukon.ca/apply-Canada-Yukon-housing-benefit</a></p>

<p>The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit builds on the Canada-Yukon Bilateral Agreement, announced last year under the National Housing Strategy, which will provide more than $75 million to protect, renew and expand social and community housing, and support Yukon’s priorities related to housing repair, construction, and affordability.</p>

<p>For the first time in a generation, the federal government is back into affordable housing with our National Housing Strategy. The Canada-Yukon Housing Benefit is a key component in developing an ambitious 10-year plan for the housing sector, and to make real progress for Yukoners. I remain committed to working with all levels of government to ensure that our communities have access to safe, affordable, and stable housing.</p>

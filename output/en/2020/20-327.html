<p><em>Please note that this news release has been updated to provide more clarity about travellers’ isolation period and sharing space within a household.</em></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, November 10, at 9 a.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 23. Twenty-one people have recovered and there is currently one active case.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Monday November 2, to Sunday, November 8, we tested 89 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre in Whitehorse. To date, we have tested 4,197 people. The centre will be open on Wednesday, November 11.</p>

<p><strong>Updates to school guidelines  </strong></p>

<p>The school health and safety guidelines for Grades K to 12 have been updated to reduce the requirement for two-metre distancing between students in the classroom and to make masks mandatory in common areas outside of the classroom. This is intended to provide clarity for all schools.  </p>

<p><strong>New travel guidance for southern BC</strong></p>

<p>British Columbia's Provincial Health Officer announced new orders this weekend. Yukoners travelling to or from BC will need to follow COVID-19 guidelines and abide by the order while they're in BC.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is monitoring BC developments and will adjust its guidelines and advice as needed based on the recommendations of Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.</p>

<p><strong>Holiday travel planning</strong></p>

<p>Yukoners who are hosting family this holiday season will need to prepare to self-isolate if they have visitors from outside BC, the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers not from the NWT, Nunavut and BC need to self-isolate with their household for two weeks after arriving in Yukon. If travellers share a space with other household members who will not be self-isolating, they must stay away from each other (two metres or six feet apart) as much as possible. Use a separate bathroom if you can, and avoid sharing household items.</p>

<p><strong>New <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> charges</strong></p>

<p>One charge was laid on November 5 for failure to transit through Yukon.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement statistics </strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has received 990 complaints as of November 9, 2020:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to self-isolate: 565</li>
	<li>Gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 26</li>

	<li>Businesses failing to comply with orders: 10</li>
	<li>Failure to abide by a declaration form or not permitted entry into Yukon: 15</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a total of 18 people charged, and 23 charges laid under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA).</p>

<p>A total of 59,826 travellers have come into Yukon:</p>

<p>Students, families, school councils, schools staff, Yukon First Nations and other education partners are invited to share their experiences and perspectives through an online tool as part of the review of inclusive and special education in Yukon.</p>

<p>Dr. Nikki Yee is reviewing inclusive and special education in Yukon in response to the 2019 Audit Report on Kindergarten to Grade 12 education. Dr. Yee is collecting experiences and perspectives from across the education system for her final report by the end of March 2021.</p>

<p>To safely gather experiences and perspectives during the pandemic, an online tool is available to fill out until January 24. The online tool allows Dr. Yee to hear from students, families and as many participants as possible across the education system. Participants are encouraged to share as many experiences about inclusive and special education services as they would like. This will ensure Dr. Yee captures a diverse range of perspectives.</p>

<p>The online tool is available in English to fill out at: <a href="https://imsva91-ctp.trendmicro.com/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fapp.spryng.io%2fgoto%2f6DhtiyieGZSruKpi2Mypyb&amp;umid=27F83809-B5FC-1605-911B-6C2B2518FB6F&amp;auth=c132af8ee7c9d1278d61a701569070a095ce962e-d7fbe57be93c0062b721a243bc5ef8c03b83ec88">https://app.spryng.io/goto/6DhtiyieGZSruKpi2Mypyb</a></p>

<p>If using a phone or tablet to fill it out, select "browser" in the pop-up to continue to the online tool. The app is not being used for this engagement.</p>

<p>The French version of the online tool will be available in the coming weeks. The link will be issued as soon as it is available.</p>

<p>With this tool students, parents, families and educators across the territory can provide their perspectives and experiences with inclusive and special education. Their perspective will help us improve education and supports for students. The most important part of this review is understanding the real and lived experiences of students, families, school staff, Yukon First Nations and education partners. I encourage everyone to take the time to participate in this important review.</p>

<p>I invite everyone, but especially students and families, to share their experiences about inclusive and special education using the online tool.  This tool not only provides a way for me to hear people’s experiences, but also can reveal trends between the experiences that diverse people have chosen to share. These trends will be critical for directing the focus of educational transformation.</p>

<p><em>Please note that we have added a clarification to the "Other approved jurisdictions" category.</em></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, September 23, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,211 people.</p>

<p><strong>Respiratory Assessment Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Wednesday, September 16, to Tuesday, September 22, we tested 98 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>The Respiratory Assessment Centre will now be known as the COVID testing centre (CTC). Hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday. Referrals are no longer required for a COVID-19 test at the centre.</p>

<p><strong>New charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act</strong><br><br>
	Below is a summary of charges laid on September 17 and September 23. We do not provide any information that may identify anyone, such as their name, where they received the charge or their contact information.</p>

<ul>
<li>One charge laid on September 17:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>failure to comply with the self-isolation order.<br>
				 </li>
		</ul>
</li>
	<li>Two charges laid on September 23:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>Two failures to comply with indoor gathering of 10 people or fewer.</li>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stop light symptom criteria for staying home from schools and daycares</strong></p>

<p>We have <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19/find-out-about-symptoms-covid-19">updated guidance based</a> on three colour zones (green, yellow and red) to help parents and guardians know when to keep children home from school or daycare. The school poster is available online and the daycare poster will be up by the end of day.</p>

<p><strong>Flu clinics to begin in mid-October</strong></p>

<p>Flu clinics throughout Yukon will begin the week of October 19 for people considered as high risk or with a chronic disease. The clinic will open to the general public on October 26. This year, the Yukon Convention Centre will be used for all Whitehorse flu clinics. The clinic will be open six days a week initially with extended hours, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. We'll release further details in early October.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement statistics </strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has received 832 complaints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to self-isolate: 466</li>
	<li>Social gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 23</li>
	<li>Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on the designated route: 321</li>
	<li>Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 9</li>
	<li>Failure to abide by a declaration form or not permitted entry into Yukon: 12</li>
	<li>Other: 1</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a total of 11 people charged, and 15 charges laid under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA).</p>

<p>A total of 48,107 travellers have come into Yukon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resident travellers: 10,060</li>
	<li>BC residents: 9,601</li>
	<li>NWT residents: 265</li>
	<li>Other approved jurisdictions: 652*</li>
	<li>Non-residents staying: 9,196</li>
	<li>Non-residents transiting: 18,270</li>
	<li>Other: 63</li>
	<li>Decals distributed indicating out-of-territory vehicles allowed in Yukon: 269</li>
</ul>
<p>* Due to the fact that the way we’ve collected traveller data has changed since we started collecting statistics, the "Other approved jurisdictions" category has been used to categorize travellers that did not fall into an existing category. We’re reviewing how we collect and categorize statistics to maintain accuracy, and will make adjustments as necessary.</p>

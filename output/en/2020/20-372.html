<p>The Yukon Advisory Committee on MMIWG2S+ has released Changing the Story to Upholding Dignity and Justice: Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ Strategy, with a signing ceremony for contributors and partners. The event took place in Whitehorse at the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre. Participants from all 14 Yukon First Nations as well as municipal, territorial and federal governments took part in person and online to confirm their commitment to ending violence and changing the story for Indigenous women, girls and Two-spirit+ people in Yukon. The Yukon's MMIWG2S+ Strategy groups 31 priority actions under four paths and takes a Yukon approach, encouraging all Yukoners to see themselves as part of the solution. </p>

<p>Today is a historic day. I am so proud of this strategy and of the work that got it to this day. This is a starting place, and we still have much work to do, but the family members, advocates, leaders and members of the Yukon Advisory Committee should take a moment to reflect on this incredible accomplishment.</p>

<p>Education leaders from across Canada are in Whitehorse for the C21 Canadians for 21st Century Learning &amp; Innovation CEO Academy Winter Summit. This is the first time this summit has taken place in Yukon.</p>

<p>This summit’s theme of Cultural Responsiveness, Relationships and Common Messages provided an opportunity for education leaders to learn about Yukon’s approach to student learning in Kindergarten through Grade 12 public education. Discussions included culturally responsive assessment and learning, Yukon First Nations Education Agreements, as well as how Yukon schools work in partnership with Yukon First Nations governments to support learning that is grounded in the community context and focused on reconciliation.</p>

<p>The summit kicked off with an opening reception at MacBride Museum on Sunday, Feb. 23 with presentations by Deputy Minister of Education Nicole Morgan and Yukon University Associate Vice-President of Indigenous Engagement Tosh Southwick. Participants visited Elijah Smith Elementary School and the Haa Shagóon Hídi, the learning entre in Carcross, to gain immersive learning experiences.</p>

<p>During the summit, the C21 Canada presented the Shifting Minds Learning and Innovation Acknowledgement to recognize all voices in Yukon, including Yukon First Nations, who have contributed to Yukon’s student-centred and culturally responsive classroom assessment model, and on creating a leading model of reconciliation for all Canadians.</p>

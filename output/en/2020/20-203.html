<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 case count</strong></p>

<p>As of today, July 22, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count is 13. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,450 people have been tested.</p>

<p><strong>Update on the start of Phase 3</strong></p>

<p>Phase 3 is expected to begin on August 1, 2020. The public is reminded that Phase 3 will be a long one, anticipated to take Yukon through until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.</p>

<p><br>
	Initially, changes under Phase 3 will be internal to the territory only. Changes being considered are expansion of family bubbles, gatherings and a return to sport play.</p>

<p>Additional changes and relaxation of other restrictions will be considered as appropriate, based on public health principles and level of risk.</p>

<p><strong>Expanded testing statistics</strong></p>

<p>Testing criteria was expanded on July 15 to include a broader range of symptoms for individuals who have not travelled. This was done in response to and in anticipation of the opening of the border with British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and flu season. Since July 15, 75 tests have been conducted. Testing is happening at Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC), the respiratory assessment centre (RAC) and, in some cases, Whitehorse General Hospital. There have been 170 tests conducted since July 1.</p>

<p><strong>Contact tracing emails</strong></p>

<p>If someone is named as a contact of a person who has COVID 19, they will be contacted by Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC). Yukoners are encouraged to be on alert for scams related to contact tracing. Any other contact tracing outreach being conducted by anyone aside from YCDC is not valid.</p>

<p>Stories are circulating about emails being sent to individuals identifying them as having been somewhere where someone has been diagnosed as positive. The email encourages the recipient to open a document for instructions, which they should not do as these emails are fraudulent. All contact tracing is done directly by YCDC.</p>

<p><strong>Visitor decals available for eligible vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates</strong></p>

<p>As of July 20, 2020, some vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates will be provided with a visitor decal when they enter Yukon at a border check station staffed by Government of Yukon enforcement officers. Visitor decals will be provided to critical service providers and travellers who have completed their 14-day self-isolation as required, including: Canadians with plates from jurisdictions outside of British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut; Americans providing essential services in Yukon; and foreign residents who have been permitted entry to Canada by the Canadian Border Services Agency.</p>

<p>The green visitor decal placed on the driver’s side of the windshield indicates that the occupants are not required to self-isolate and the vehicle is authorized to travel in and around Yukon.</p>

<p>People in Yukon with out-of-territory plates can pick up a visitor decal at the Emergency Measures Office located at 60 Norseman Road in Whitehorse. People living in Yukon communities can contact <a href="mailto:covid19enforcement@gov.yk.ca">covid19enforcement@gov.yk.ca</a> to request a visitor decal. Eligible visitors must first have completed their 14-day self-isolation period, if it was required.</p>

<p>Visitors as well as residents are reminded to be kind, respectful and be safe. Everyone is encouraged to practise the<a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/6-steps-staying-safe-covid-19"> Safe 6.</a></p>

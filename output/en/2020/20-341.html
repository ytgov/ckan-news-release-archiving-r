	<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, bringing the territory’s total to 32 cases.</p>

	<p>Cases 30 and 31 have been linked to previous cases while case 32 is related to out-of-territory travel. The case investigation is underway and Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) is reaching out to contacts.</p>

	<p>An additional public exposure notice is now issued for an already identified location:</p>

	<ul>
<li>Better Bodies, Whitehorse
			<ul>
<li>Monday, November 16, between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.</li>
			</ul>
</li>
	</ul>
<p>Anyone who’s experiencing the symptoms listed below and was at Better Bodies on that date should contact the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 in Whitehorse. Due to a high volume of calls, people may be required to leave a number. The COVID Testing and Assessment Centre staff will then return calls.</p>

	<p>Anyone who has the following symptoms, should self-isolate and arrange for testing immediately:  <br>
		 </p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Chills</li>
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>Shortness of breath</li>
	<li>Runny nose</li>
	<li>Sore throat</li>
	<li>Loss of sense of taste or smell</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Fatigue</li>
	<li>Loss of appetite</li>
	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
	<li>Diarrhea</li>
	<li>Muscle aches</li>
</ul>
<p>People who were at the other recently named exposure locations should also self-monitor for symptoms. This means watch for any of the symptoms listed above. If any symptoms occur, self-isolate and arrange for testing.</p>

<p>For community exposures such as this, it’s only necessary to self-isolate if symptoms occur. Someone who’s in contact with a person who was at the exposure locations is not required to self-isolate or to self-monitor.</p>

<p>Anyone who has symptoms but was not at a named location should self-isolate, take the online self-assessment, call 811 and arrange for testing at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or through their rural community health centre.</p>

<p>An up-to-date list of potential community exposures can be found <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/potential-covid-19-exposure-notices">here.</a></p>

<p>All Yukoners are reminded to self-isolate when they:</p>

<ul>
<li>have symptoms;</li>
	<li>have had a test and are waiting for results;</li>
	<li>have returned to Yukon from travel outside the territory within the past 14 days; or</li>
	<li>have been instructed to self-isolate by the Testing and Assessment Centre or their health care provider.</li>

<p>Premier Sandy Silver announced today that Scott Thompson has been appointed as the new deputy minister for the Department of Finance.</p>

<p>Thompson worked for the Government of Ontario for 33 years and was the deputy minister for multiple ministries including finance, transportation, and infrastructure. Throughout his career, Thompson has maintained a strong commitment to improving public policy development and decision-making, and helping to guide public servants into being the leaders of tomorrow’s public sector. He was a valued member of the Public Service Commission of Ontario and served as the board chair for the Ontario Financing Authority. Thompson has a bachelor of environmental studies in urban and regional planning from the University of Waterloo, and did graduate studies in transportation planning at the University of Illinois before joining the Ontario government. Most recently he served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of Public Administration of Canada.</p>

<p>Thompson will join the Government of Yukon on March 2, 2020.</p>

<p>Chris Mahar has been acting deputy minister since March 2019. Mahar will be retiring but will remain with the department until April 2020 to provide a smooth leadership transition.</p>

<p>Scott Thompson brings a wealth of leadership experience and a deep knowledge of government finance. Not only does he have the subject matter expertise but he also has a track record as a leader who supports and develops others. We are excited to have him join the Yukon government.<br><br>
	I am happy that Chris will join her partner in retirement, but am very sad to see her go. With her decades of experience across government, her absence will be felt. In typical and true Chris fashion, she put the Finance department team’s needs ahead of all else, and has agreed to stay on until April to ensure a smooth transition. It is this type of selfless action that has earned Ms. Mahar the respect of my cabinet colleagues as well as her peers in the public service. I am grateful for her tutelage and dedication to her role.</p>

<p><em>This is a joint news release with the Government of Canada. </em></p>

<p>Today, the Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon announced a research program that focusses on gathering the unique information needed to support Yukon’s strategic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The program is requesting expressions of interest for research projects to support the territory’s recovery from the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. </p>

<p>The goal of the program is to fund research that will increase understanding of the social, cultural, environmental, economic and health impacts of COVID-19 and address gaps in research and data specific to Yukon.</p>

<p>Through the financial support of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, the Government of Yukon is able to offer a total of $1 million in funding.</p>

<p>The research will support the pandemic-related planning and decision-making needs of the Government of Yukon, the Government of Canada, First Nations governments and communities, and other Yukon organizations.</p>

<p>We thank the federal government for their support for the Recovery Research Program, which will help increase our understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on our communities and contribute to the territory’s recovery. This is a broad fund open to proposals from community organizations, governments, academics and industry. We particularly encourage partnership-based and Indigenous-led research.</p>

<p>I want to thank the leadership of the Government of Yukon for implementing innovative solutions to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the health of Canadians and our economy. Supporting this initiative is part of the Government of Canada’s commitment to implementing key partner priorities of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, including Yukon’s priority to support research specific in the North. COVID-19 has exacerbated many pre-existing Northern challenges, including the need for information and data that reflects the specific needs of Northerners to guide decisions. This investment will help improve our understanding of the specific impacts of COVID-19 in Yukon and how best to respond.</p>

<p>This research initiative will not only inform decision-making in Yukon and solidly reflect Indigenous values and perspectives, but also enhance Yukon’s science and research community by providing local opportunities for researchers to collaborate with decision-makers. The territory’s longer-term strategic recovery from the pandemic requires informed cooperation and partnership that reflect Yukon-specific needs.</p>

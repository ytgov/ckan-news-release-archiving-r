<p>The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Government of Yukon have finalized more detailed health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings and school bus operations. The guidelines will help schools plan for the return of students to classes for the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>Department of Education central administration staff are working with school principals and school staff to finalize school operational plans and adapt their school routines based on these health and safety guidelines. School principals will share finalized school operational plans with school communities by August 12 before the start of the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<h2>Health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings</h2>

<p>School operations are being adapted based on the health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings, including ensuring: </p>

<ul>
<li>safe spacing in classrooms and common areas;</li>
	<li>proper cleaning and disinfecting of the school and high-touch areas and equipment;</li>
	<li>students and staff know when and how they should clean or sanitize their hands;</li>
	<li>safe handling of food and use of water fountains;</li>
	<li>processes are in place if a students or staff gets sick or show symptoms; and</li>
	<li>students and staff know to stay home if they are sick or show symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Health and safety guidelines for school bus operations</h2>

<p>School bus services are being adapted based on the health and safety guidelines for school bus operations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintaining physical distance of two metres when waiting for the bus;</li>
	<li>loading students on the bus from back to front, and offloading students from front to back to support physical distancing;</li>
	<li>seating students at a two-metre distance from school bus drivers;</li>
	<li>limiting students to two per seat, unless they are from the same household and using assigned seats;</li>
	<li>ensuring students and bus drivers are washing or sanitizing their hands before and after boarding the school bus; and</li>
	<li>cleaning and disinfecting buses, including high-touch areas after each trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education encourage families to arrange for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool to transport students to and from school this year, if possible to allow for more room on buses for students without other means of transport.</p>

<p>Careful thought and planning have gone into these health and safety guidelines to enable students to return to in-classroom learning. It is critical that we support our kids’ ability to learn and thrive in a face to face educational environment. The work we have undertaken with Education allows this to happen in the safest manner possible for students and their teachers.</p>

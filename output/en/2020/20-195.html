<p>The Government of Yukon is surveying students, families and educators to learn more about the impacts of the pandemic on student learning as it continues to plan for the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>Students, families and school staff are being asked about their experiences and perspectives around learning during the pandemic. The feedback received will help identify which activities and supports were effective for learning during the end of the 2019–20 school year, when face-to-face classes were suspended.</p>

<p>Survey topics include:</p>

<ul>
<li>effectiveness of activities, supports and practices for learning;</li>
	<li>effectiveness of communication between home and school;</li>
	<li>access to technology and internet to support learning;</li>
	<li>information and resources for school staff; and</li>
	<li>suggestions for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The survey was developed with input from Yukon First Nations, school councils, the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon and the Yukon Teachers’ Association. The results of the survey will be shared with school communities and will inform the delivery of instruction for the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>The survey is available from July 15 to 22. The survey link has been sent directly to families and school staff to fill out online. It can also be filled out by calling 867-667-8226 during the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays during the survey period. Follow up surveys to check in on the effectiveness of learning activities and supports during the 2020–21 school year will also be conducted.</p>

<p>We want to learn more from students, families and school staff about their experiences learning during the pandemic. The results of this survey will help us continue planning and adapt instruction and learning to be responsive to students’ learning needs and support educators. I encourage everyone involved in Yukon’s education system to provide feedback to ensure student learning remains effective as we continue to navigate the upcoming school year.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 case count</strong></p>

<p>As of today, June 24, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,265 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20.</p>

<p><strong>Border controls to be eased</strong></p>

<p>Starting July 1, residents of British Columbia and Yukon will be allowed to travel back and forth without the need to self-isolate for 14 days. BC residents entering Yukon will need to provide documentation proving their BC residence at the border or airport, such as a driver’s licence.</p>

<p>Also from July 1, residents of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut will be allowed to enter Yukon without needing to self-isolate for 14 days, as long as they travel directly to Yukon from one of the territories or through BC.</p>

<p>The decision to ease border restrictions was made based on careful risk assessments and confidence in the territory’s health care capacity and ability to contact trace if new cases arrive in Yukon.</p>

<p><strong>Resources for vulnerable populations</strong></p>

<p>To help Yukoners at risk during this pandemic, vulnerable populations can now access <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/industry-operating-guidelines-covid-19/vulnerable">mental health and social supports online</a>. This includes homeless people, those experiencing or at risk of gender-based violence, people with disabilities, seniors and those with underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Pools to reopen</strong></p>

<p>Effective July 1, public pools will be able to operate with an approved operational plan. Swimming and other water-related activities are excellent ways to get the physical activity needed for a healthy life.</p>

<p>The use of public pools is considered a low-risk activity as long as pools are operated safely and are properly maintained. All requirements in the Public Pool Regulations, under the <em>Public Health and Safety Ac</em>t, must be adhered to. An operational plan must be submitted to <a href="mailto:COVID19info@gov.yk.ca">COVID19info@gov.yk.ca</a> and there must be a pre-opening public pool inspection. Pool operators throughout the territory have been advised of this information.</p>

<p><strong>Farmers market </strong></p>

<p>Beginning July 1, Yukon farmers' markets can welcome non-food vendors (such as artisans and soap and flower sellers). Information booths will continue to be excluded. In addition, market organizers have been advised they now have the ability to offer seating and an outdoor dining experience to the public as long as physical distancing is maintained. Buskers are also allowed to return to the market beginning July 1.</p>

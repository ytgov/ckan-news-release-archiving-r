<p>The Government of Yukon is planning for Kindergarten to Grade 12 students to return to classes in school at the start of the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>As part of A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions, initial health and safety guidance for Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools has been developed with Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health to start planning for changes to the operations of Yukon schools for the 2020–21 school year. Health and safety guidelines will be developed before the start of the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>Each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet Yukon’s health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools while meeting the unique needs and context of school communities. School principals and staff will share this information before the start of the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>This has been a challenging time for students and families. We know that the longer we are out of regular routines the more mental health and wellness are affected. Planning is well underway to return our students to school in the fall, knowing that schools will be following new guidelines to protect the health and safety of students, school staff and communities.</p>

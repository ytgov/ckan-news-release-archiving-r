<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and test results</strong></p>

<p>As of today, March 27, at 3 p.m. there are four cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. All four people are doing well at home.</p>

<p>Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests.</p>

<p><strong>Managing COVID-19 cases</strong></p>

<p>As new cases of COVID-19 occur, those who are connected to infected people will continue to be traced and informed so they can take the necessary measures of monitoring themselves for symptoms for up to 14 days.</p>

<p>Yukoners are urged to behave as if COVID-19 is already in their community. They should continue to keep a physical distance of two meters or six feet from each other and practice greater hygiene.</p>

<p>Yukoners are also strongly advised to avoid passing on inaccurate information they may hear about cases of infection. This creates additional anxiety at a time when many people are already struggling to maintain their mental health. </p>

<p><strong>Federal quarantine measures</strong></p>

<p>As many Yukoners will know, the Government of Canada now requires mandatory 14-day self-isolation for everyone entering Canada even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>Yukoners flying into Canada with symptoms must quarantine at their arrival destination. Yukoners flying into Canada who do not have symptoms may travel home to the territory where they must then follow Yukon requirements and self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p><strong>Dental services</strong></p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer of Health is from today ordering the territory’s dental practices to suspend all non-urgent treatment until further notice. This is to protect Yukoners as well as dental care providers from the spread of infection.</p>

<p>Patients with queries should contact their dental clinic.</p>

<p><strong>Mining industry guidance </strong></p>

<p>Everyone arriving in Yukon must <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/information-self-isolation">self-isolate</a> for 14 days, including workers at placer or hard rock mines, exploration camps or conducting any other business or duty associated with the mining and exploration industry. Workers cannot carry out their regular duties in a camp or at a mine while they’re self-isolating.</p>

<p>Further guidance for the mining industry is on Yukon.ca.</p>

<p><em>Please note that the CTAC and drive-thru holiday hours have been updated. </em></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of today, December 22, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 59. Fifty-eight people have recovered, one person has died and there are no active cases. We have tested 5,872 people.</p>

<h3>Visitor isolation options and guidelines</h3>

<p>There are options for visitors to Yukon who are sharing accommodations with others who have not travelled outside Yukon.</p>

<p>Option 1</p>

<p>Visitors can self-isolate for 14 days without physical distancing within a home if all residents are isolating together with no outside contact. For example, a visiting university student and their family can hug, share meals and share living spaces if no one has contact outside the home for the entire isolation period.</p>

<p>Households that have guests departing prior to the 14 days may leave isolation three days after their departure, as long as they self-monitor and check in with their guests. If neither have symptoms during those three days then they're able to return to their daily lives.</p>

<p>Option 2</p>

<p>If someone in the household chooses to go to work, school or run errands, then guests in self-isolation must maintain two metres distance at all times within that home.</p>

<p>More information about visitor self-isolation is available at: <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/information-self-isolation">https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/information-self-isolation</a></p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing schedule during the holidays</h3>

<p>During the holidays, t<span style="font-size: 16px;">he COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) </span> will close at 4 p.m. on December 24 and remain closed December 25 and 26. The drive-thru testing centre will be closed from December 25 to 28 as well as on January 1.</p>

<p>Those experiencing severe symptoms and requiring immediate assistance can go to the Whitehorse General Hospital Emergency Department, a community hospital or health centre.</p>

<p>From Monday, December 14, to Sunday, December 20, we tested 80 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) and drive-thru testing locations in Whitehorse.</p>

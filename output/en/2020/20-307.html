<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, October 21, at 11 a.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 17. Fifteen people have recovered and there are currently two active cases, with both people in self-isolation and recovering at home. We have tested 3,814 people.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Testing Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Tuesday, October 13, to Monday, October 19, we tested 100 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) in Whitehorse.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting public concerns</strong></p>

<p>Be kind and understanding. People in transit through the territory are now driving in winter conditions. Report concerns to <a href="mailto:covid19info@gov.yk.ca">covid19info@gov.yk.ca</a> or phone 1-877-374-0425 and avoid direct actions when suspecting someone is not following measures.</p>

<p><strong>Flu clinics</strong></p>

<p>Yukon’s influenza vaccine has been available since Monday, October 19, with the first week aimed at those more vulnerable to complications from influenza. These include Yukon residents with chronic medical conditions, as well as those over 65, pregnant women and young children.</p>

<p>Vaccines will be available for the general public as of Monday, October 26. Due to COVID-19, clinics will have been rearranged to ensure proper safety precautions are taken. In addition, certain pharmacists within Whitehorse are offering flu shots by appointment this year.</p>

<p><strong>Gatherings and social bubbles </strong></p>

<p>All Yukoners are reminded to adhere to Yukon’s guidance on gatherings and keep social groups small and intimate. Your social bubble can include 15 people but you should not socialize with more than 10 at a time indoors. If you gather with anyone who is not in your social bubble, you must keep a two-metre (six feet) distance from them at all times. Organized and seated gatherings have higher limits, as long as all precautions are observed. See Yukon.ca for more details. </p>

<p><strong>New <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> charge</strong></p>

<p>One charge was laid on October 19 for a Yukon resident who travelled outside of Yukon, BC, the NWT and Nunavut within the previous 14 days and did not follow self-isolation requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Canada and US border</strong></p>

<p>Canada and the US has continued to extend the border closures to non-essential travel until November 21. Yukoners can find more information about what is considered essential travel <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#_Canada-U.S._border_restrictions_1">here.</a></p>

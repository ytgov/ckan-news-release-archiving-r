<p>The Government of Yukon is extending the review of inclusive and special education into the 2020–21 school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension will provide more time and opportunities to safely connect and gather perspectives on these programs and services.</p>

<p>Engagement opportunities with families, educators, school communities, partners and Yukon First Nations originally planned for April and May 2020 are being rescheduled for this fall. The extended engagement opportunities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>An online tool to gather perspectives and experiences from students, families, partners, school communities, staff and the public.</li>
	<li>Focus groups led by the review consultant with:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>Educators, including Learning Assistance Teachers, School Counsellors, Educational Assistants, etc.;</li>
			<li>Yukon First Nations;</li>
			<li>School Councils; and</li>
			<li>The Advisory Committee for Yukon Education and other professionals who work with children and youth with diverse needs.</li>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An interim update on the review is now available, with the information gathered to date by the consultant about Yukon’s current service model for these programs, along with questions and resources to consider as the review moves forward.</p>

<p>The consultant’s final report for this review and a summary of what was heard through the engagement activities will be shared by the end of March 2021.</p>

<p>Along with the recommendations from the 2019 audit report, this report will be used to frame collaboration with Yukon First Nations and education partners to respond to the feedback and findings from this review and together develop next steps and actions to improve and modernize these programs to more effectively support student learning needs and outcomes.</p>

<p>I appreciate how open people have been in sharing their thoughts about inclusive and special education. Even at these early stages, I can see that there are some incredible strengths here in the Yukon that can serve as a springboard to address the challenges that have been identified. It’s unfortunate the work had to be put on hold due to the pandemic, but it has provided a good opportunity to reflect on the process and on the discussions that have happened so far. I hope this interim update can inspire people to start thinking about their own stories with inclusive and special education, and the kinds of changes they’d like to see. I look forward to connecting with people to hear those stories and ideas once the review starts back up again.</p>

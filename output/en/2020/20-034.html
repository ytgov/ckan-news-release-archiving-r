<p>Residents are moving in to Yukon’s first-ever Housing First residence on Fifth Avenue as part of a staged occupancy plan that began in mid-February. The plan will see two tenants move in each week until the building is full.</p>

<p>The 16-unit building is the first Housing First project in the territory and signifies the Government of Yukon’s commitment to addressing homelessness and poverty in Yukon.</p>

<p>Housing First is a modern, progressive approach to addressing poverty that centres on providing immediate access to permanent homes with no ‘readiness’ requirements, such as needing citizens to be alcohol- or drug-free. It is recovery-oriented and focused on consumer choice, self-determination and community integration. The goal is to encourage housing stability and improved quality of life and foster self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>It is a key part of the housing continuum in Whitehorse and provides an additional option for some of the most vulnerable homeless citizens in Yukon. The total project cost was $4.4 million, which included design, site and utilities preparation, and construction.</p>

<p>Several non-government agencies provide outreach and ongoing client support services. This work will continue with shelter residents.</p>

<p>Knowing that people are moving into their new homes, and hearing they feel safe and secure lets me know that we have done the right thing to support those who are most in need. This is a critical part of the housing continuum, and I am pleased that our government is taking active steps towards addressing the housing and support needs of some of the most vulnerable members of our community.</p>

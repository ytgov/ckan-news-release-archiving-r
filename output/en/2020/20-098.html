<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, April 8, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon is eight.</p>

<p>The eighth case is in a rural Yukon community. The patient is self-isolating and doing well at home. This case is linked to international travel.</p>

<p>Four of the eight people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have now recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital.</p>

<p>Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered.</p>

<p><strong>Identifying rural communities where COVID-19 is present</strong></p>

<p>When a case is diagnosed in a rural community, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health will not publicly identify the community. This commitment is made for several reasons including the need to protect the personal health information and privacy of the individual and anyone affected.</p>

<p>Individual cases that are contained do not increase the risk to the public. There is concern that if communities are identified, the community or people who are affected may be stigmatized.</p>

<p>If there are specific places where contact may have occurred and contacts are unknown, those locations may need to be posted regardless of the community.</p>

<p><strong>Easter weekend </strong></p>

<p>Yukoners are reminded to do what they can to help stop the spread of COVID-19 over the Easter weekend so the territory remains free of known community transmission.</p>

<p>This means staying close to home, avoiding activities that risk the need for emergency services to be called out and keeping a safe, two-metre distance from anyone who’s not a member of the same household. People should do grocery and other shopping alone as much as possible and not play sports or games with people who are not from the same household.</p>

<p>However, Yukoners who are healthy and not self-isolating should not take this to mean they cannot see local family and friends who are not vulnerable to infection. Yukoners connecting with others should keep safely spaced at all times, practise greater hygiene and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.</p>

<p>As announced on March 22, people are strongly advised not to travel to Yukon rural communities unless their journey is essential.</p>

<p><strong>Playgrounds</strong></p>

<p>Healthy Yukoners are also reminded that they may go to local parks and playgrounds to get fresh air and play as long as they keep safely spaced from anyone who’s not in their household. As territorial campgrounds are closed, the playgrounds in these sites are also closed.</p>

<p><strong>Doctor appointments</strong></p>

<p>People with ailments or conditions not related to COVID-19 are encouraged to call their doctors for appointments in the usual way. They can talk to their doctor by phone and their doctor will determine whether a face to face appointment is necessary.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks they have COVID-19 symptoms should call Yukon HealthLine 811 or use the COVID-19 self-assessment tool on Yukon.ca.</p>

<p><strong>Schools</strong></p>

<p>With face-to-face classes suspended for the rest of the school year, parents and caregivers are encouraged to help children continue to learn but in the role of a guide rather than putting pressure on themselves to step into the role of a teacher. </p>

<p>Tips for supporting children at this challenging time include talking to them about COVID-19 while also restricting their access to online news about the pandemic, maintaining a regular daily structure and teaching children the basics of increased hygiene while not becoming upset if they forget.</p>

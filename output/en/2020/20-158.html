<p>Today, June 3, marks the one-year anniversary of the formal release of the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirited individuals (MMIWG2S+): “Reclaiming Power and Place<em>”</em>. The Final Report comprises the truths of more than 2,380 family members, survivors of violence, experts and Knowledge Keepers gathered from two years of public hearings and evidence gathering. It delivers 231 individual Calls for Justice directed at governments, institutions, social service providers, industries and all Canadians.</p>

<p>Last year, the Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) on MMIWG developed a first draft of the Yukon Strategy on MMIWG2S+ based on the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice, a review of other national and territorial reports, and recommendations from past gatherings of MMIWG2S+ family members. This long-term strategy will represent a whole of Yukon approach, outlining specific action plans and roles for all stakeholders and all Yukoners to play.</p>

<p>Minister Jeanie Dendys, as a co-chair of the committee, has engaged with 12 First Nations and five municipal governments to discuss their feedback and participation in the strategy. Unfortunately, the realities of COVID-19 delayed meeting with the remaining First Nations and municipal governments in person, so those meetings will take place virtually.</p>

<p>In recognition of the valuable expertise and experience of family members of MMIWG2S+, the strategy will keep the voices of families at the centre. Although a large gathering of family members scheduled for March 21 to 22 had to be cancelled, input into the strategy will still be coordinated through small and virtual gatherings in the coming months.  The final document will then be shared with all stakeholders for signing.</p>

<p>The Yukon Advisory Committee had hoped to have finalized Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ Strategy before reaching the milestone of the first anniversary of the release of the National Inquiry’s final report. COVID-19 delayed progress in meeting that goal, but Yukoners should rest assured that the committee is still moving forward with this important work and will create a whole of Yukon strategy that will change the story for Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ2S+ Yukoners.</p>

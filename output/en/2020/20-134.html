<p>Yukon’s societies, business corporations and cooperatives can now hold their official meetings online with electronic and teleconferencing technology.</p>

<p>Last week, Community Services extended the deadlines for AGMs as an interim measure. A Ministerial Order under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA) issued today provides additional flexibility for groups wishing to hold annual general meetings (AGMs) right away. Depending upon organizations’ articles, bylaws and partnership agreements, the current COVID19 ban on gatherings of more than 10 people can impede businesses, societies and other organizations from holding AGMs as required by the current legislation governing them.</p>

<p>This order broadens the options for organizations to hold AGMs, regardless of specific provisions in their bylaws or partnership agreements.</p>

<p>This order is effective retroactively to March 17, 2020. It continues for 90 days past the end of the COVID-19 state of emergency for organizations governed by the Societies Act and Cooperative Associations Act. The order extends for 30 days after the end of the emergency for organizations governed by the <em>Partnership and Business Names Act</em> and the <em>Business Corporations Act</em>. </p>

<p>We continue to respond to the needs of Yukoners. The need for in-person meetings can be a significant barrier to businesses and societies during the COVID19 pandemic. They can now hold their regulated meetings, including annual general meetings, electronically or by teleconference. For instance, societies will be able to hold their mandatory annual general meetings and submit their approved year-end reports and financial statements to remain in compliance with the <em>Societies Act </em>and receive funding. We made the order retroactive to support any society or business, which has already held their AGM online in good faith.</p>

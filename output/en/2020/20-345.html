<p><strong>Clarity regarding public health notifications</strong></p>

<p>Public health notifications are meant to alert Yukoners about potential exposures at locations during specific times and dates. However, a notification does not mean that an organization or business establishment has necessarily been closed or currently poses a public health concern.</p>

<p><strong>Mandatory masks starting December 1</strong></p>

<p>As of December 1, it will be mandatory to wear a non-medical mask in all indoor public spaces. This will extend to all Yukoners over the age of two with very limited exceptions. A list of places of exemption and people who will be granted exemption will be available on yukon.ca before December 1.</p>

<p><strong>New self-isolation rules</strong></p>

<p>If you are planning to have guests from outside of Yukon during the holidays, you must be aware of the <a href="https://yukon.ca/puneet_node/15949">new self-isolation rules</a>. Self-isolation option one will allow you to share meals and hugs with your guests, however every member of your household will be required to self-isolate for 14 days or If your guest leaves before 14 days, you must continue to self-isolate for three days. If everyone in your household and your departed guest do not have symptoms after three days, your household is free to leave your self-isolation.</p>

<p><strong>Drive-Thru screening in Whitehorse</strong></p>

<p>Located at the old Centennial Motors wash bay, this drive-thru will provide screening for those who are experiencing symptoms and require testing. Testing will be available from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. until Saturday, November 28 2020.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Testing Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Monday, November 16, to Sunday, November 22, we tested 296 people at the CTAC in Whitehorse.</p>

<p><strong>Prepared to address positive cases within schools        </strong></p>

<p>If there is a case connected to a student or staff at one of our schools, we will follow the advice and recommendations of Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health and Yukon Communicable Disease Control. Learn more at yukon.ca</p>

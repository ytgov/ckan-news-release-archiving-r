<p><em>Please note that we have added a clarification to the "Other approved jurisdictions" category.</em></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 case count</strong></p>

<p>As of today, August 19, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. All 15 people have recovered. We have tested 2,270 people.</p>

<p><strong>Respiratory Assessment Centre</strong></p>

<p>From August 12 to August 18, 139 people went to the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse and we tested 134 people.</p>

<p><strong>Extension of US border restrictions</strong></p>

<p>The Canada Border Services Agency and US Customs are temporarily restricting all non-essential travel across its borders to limit the spread of COVID-19 as a precautionary measure. They’ve extended the current border measures until September 21, 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term care visiting restrictions eased</strong></p>

<p>Residents of Yukon’s five long-term care homes can now receive two designated visitors indoors. They can also have an additional two designated visitors for outside visits. Age restrictions have also been lifted.</p>

<p>We closed long-term care homes to visitors and volunteers on March 16. Outdoor visits were introduced on June 12 for two designated visitors. All visits must be booked in advance. Work continues on planning to reintroduce volunteers to facilities. For more information on these changes, see Yukon.ca.</p>

<p><strong>Travel manners</strong></p>

<p>Yukoners are reminded to follow the Safe 6 even when outside Yukon. As more concerns are raised about the open border with BC and increasing case counts in that province, the Chief Medical Officer of Health says following the Safe 6 is the surest way to stay safe and protect against the spread of COVID-19 both in and out of the territory.</p>

<p><strong>Case announcement</strong></p>

<p>Going forward, new cases of COVID-19 will be identified through news releases and on Yukon.ca. Media events to announce each new case will not be held. As part of living with COVID-19, new cases are expected in the coming months and as we begin to normalize our new reality, we will continue to announce new cases as they’re diagnosed through a news release and on Yukon.ca.</p>

<p><strong>Stay home if you’re sick</strong></p>

<p>While it’s been one of the Safe 6 throughout the duration of the pandemic, staying home when you’re sick has never been more important. Anyone who’s feeling unwell should not go to school or work. If you do not feel well, check the COVID-19 list of symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete <a href="https://service.yukon.ca/en/covid-19-self-assessment/">the online assessment</a> and get tested if it’s recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Public complaints received</strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has received 559 COVID-19 related complaints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to self-isolate: 303</li>
	<li>Gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 15</li>
	<li>Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on their designated route: 223</li>
	<li>Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 7</li>
	<li>Failure to abide by a declaration or not permitted entry into Yukon: 1</li>
	<li>Number of charges under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA): 6</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incoming travellers</strong></p>

<p>A total of 34,316 travellers have come into Yukon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resident travellers: 6,303</li>
	<li>BC residents: 4,139</li>
	<li>NWT residents: 104</li>
	<li>Other approved jurisdictions: 84*</li>
	<li>Non-residents staying: 8,143</li>
	<li>Non-residents transiting: 15,533</li>
	<li>Other: 10</li>
	<li>Number of decals issued: 185</li>
</ul>
<p>* Due to the fact that the way we’ve collected traveller data has changed since we started collecting statistics, the "Other approved jurisdictions" category has been used to categorize travellers that did not fall into an existing category. We’re reviewing how we collect and categorize statistics to maintain accuracy, and will make adjustments as necessary.</p>

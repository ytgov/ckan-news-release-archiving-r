<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 case count</strong></p>

<p>As of today, July 15, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,365 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20.</p>

<p><strong>Border control statistics</strong></p>

<p>Our border measures have given us the time to prepare for COVID-19, including enhancing our testing, tracking and tracing capacity. Since the start of Phase 2 on July 1, 1,587 British Columbia residents and 1,130 Yukoners have entered Yukon. In that time, 1,627 people have transited through the territory. The Government of Yukon Emergency Coordination Centre received 119 complaints from the public since July 1. Since border restrictions began earlier this year, four individuals have been fined for violating the C<em>ivil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA). Right now there are approximately 45 enforcement officers in the territory.</p>

<p><strong>Government of Yukon working arrangement update</strong></p>

<p>During Phase 2 and as we transition into Phase 3, many employees will gradually be returning to the workplace though some will continue to work from home depending on operational requirements and employee circumstances. At the height of employees working remotely, approximately 50 per cent of the government’s workforce was working from home. Currently the percentage of employees working from home is approximately 34 per cent. A gradual return to the workplace will ensure the ongoing health and safety of employees.</p>

<p>Health measures adopted during Phase 2 will be instrumental in helping the organization adapt to existing and emerging challenges. Employees who will be returning can expect to have a conversation with their supervisor about the details of coming back into the workplace. Some measures in place include directional tape and signage on the floor and walls, adhering to the six steps to staying safe, including physical distancing, and having less or different access to communal spaces such as kitchens.</p>

<p><strong>Whitehorse Public Library to reopen to public</strong></p>

<p>The Whitehorse Public Library will reopen its doors to the public on July 21, 2020. The Chief Medical Officer of Health had ordered the facility closed on March 18, 2020. Since then, the library had continued to offer some services, with curbside pickup of library materials added on June 15, 2020.</p>

<p>The reopening of the facility’s doors marks the next phase in the library’s overall reopening plan. It will allow the public to once again browse the library’s materials and borrow books, DVDs and CDs in person. There will also be limited access to the library’s public computers, printing and reference desk services.</p>

<p>To support physical distancing and the safety of both the public and staff, the library has introduced a few changes as part of this phase of reopening. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>hand sanitizing requirements on entry;</li>
	<li>limited seating until new. more easily sanitized, furniture arrives;</li>
	<li>reducing the number of computer stations and usage times; and</li>
	<li>asking people to bring in their own headphones to use at the public computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Whitehorse Public Library will be open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Local library boards manage community libraries across the territory and determine what services community libraries will provide during the pandemic. Patrons in the communities can find out the latest by calling their local library directly.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 case count</strong></p>

<p>As of today, June 17, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,245 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20.</p>

<p><strong>Full dental services to resume in Yukon</strong></p>

<p>Dental professionals may again offer full dental services in the territory beginning on July 1. All dental care except emergency and urgent procedures had previously been suspended due to the pandemic on March 27. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has recommended the resumption of full dental services as part of the territory’s COVID-19 reopening plan, which enters Phase 2 on July 1.</p>

<p>Dental professionals will be able to offer non-urgent services, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>initial or periodic oral examinations or recall visits;</li>
	<li>routine dental cleaning and preventative therapies;</li>
	<li>routine radiographs;</li>
	<li>extraction of asymptomatic teeth;</li>
	<li>aesthetic dental procedures;</li>
	<li>dental implants;</li>
	<li>restorative dentistry; and</li>
	<li>non-painful chronic periapical lesions.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, dental professionals must continue to follow the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s Recommended practices and personal protective equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Guidelines issued</strong></p>

<p>Guidelines have now been created and posted for the operation of fitness centres and gyms. This guidance does not apply to recreation centres with pools, arenas, sports fields or large indoor spaces for gatherings. It is designed for public indoor spaces designed for shared fitness purposes. An operational plan must be submitted if the operation employs staff and the <a href="https://yukon.ca/puneet_node/14378">safe six</a> must be applied.</p>

<p>Guidelines for the operation of public recreation centres have also been released. These guidelines address facilities with large indoor spaces, pools, running tracks, curling and ice rinks, etc. Again, operational plans must be submitted and the <a href="https://yukon.ca/puneet_node/14378">safe six</a> adhered to. </p>

<p><strong>Restaurants at full capacity</strong></p>

<p>Beginning July 1, Yukon restaurants can increase their operating capacity from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. Restaurants were closed to all but take out services on March 22 and reopened at 50 per cent on May 29. Restaurants will still be required to follow the reopening food premises guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Gatherings </strong></p>

<p>As of July 1, outdoor gatherings in Yukon may have up to 50 people in attendance. These should still respect physical distancing guidelines and may not serve shared food. No buffets or pot lucks are permitted at this time. The limit for indoor gatherings remains at 10 or fewer.</p>

<p><strong>Yukon public library update</strong></p>

<p>Public libraries throughout Yukon will begin providing varying levels of service to their respective communities. People should contact their local library for more details. </p>

<p>Whitehorse Public Library currently offers curbside service. Patrons can place holds on materials via phone at 867-667-5239, by emailing <a href="mailto:whitehorse.library@gov.yk.ca">whitehorse.library@gov.yk.ca</a> or by visiting <a href="https://www.pac.gov.yk.ca/#section=home">www.pac.gov.yk.ca</a>. Books on hold can be picked up Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>

<p>Appropriate physical distancing measures will be in place for the library curbside pickup and library items will be processed according to recommended national guidelines and safety protocols. This includes a quarantine period, which means a delay in getting books back into circulation. Late fees will continue to be waived and extended loan periods remain in place. The e-library continues to be available for use.</p>

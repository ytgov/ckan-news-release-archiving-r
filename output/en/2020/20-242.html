<p>The Government of Yukon is pleased to announce the latest recipients of its Arts Fund, Advanced Artist Award and On Yukon Time arts funding programs. Representing approximately $345,000, the three funding streams were boosted this spring with additional funds, expanded eligibility and extra intake dates to help offset the effects of COVID-19 across the arts sector.</p>

<p>For this intake of Arts Fund, just under $110,000 was split between nine Yukon organizations for a variety of performances, displays and community arts development. Recipients include the Selkirk First Nation, Yukon Transportation Museum and the Yukon School of Visual Arts.</p>

<p>Designed to assist the territory’s elite artists with projects and personal development, a special intake of the Advanced Artist Award saw $150,000 in funding conferred to 22 Yukon artists in the mediums of film, music, poetry, painting, textiles and more.</p>

<p>Through the On Yukon Time program, 22 recipients ranging from musicians, carvers, writers, theatre troupes and community organizations have been awarded a total of just under $85,000. This intake of the On Yukon Time program was adapted for COVID-19 to include responses to the pandemic, and performances designed to work within the realities of physical distancing and other health restrictions.</p>

<p>Details for the projects and beneficiaries are listed in the related information links below.</p>

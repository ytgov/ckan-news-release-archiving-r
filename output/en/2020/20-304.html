<p>The Government of Yukon has increased School Council honoraria rates for School Council members for the first time since 1991.</p>

<p>Recognizing the important role and responsibilities of School Councils and Boards in the governance of Yukon public schools, the Government of Yukon has increased the maximum honoraria rates for School Council members and Chairs, and for School Board trustees. School councils and boards provide a voice for students and families on developing policies, growth planning, input on the school calendar, school renovations, staffing needs and school programs.</p>

<p>To support this honoraria rate increase, the Government of Yukon is increasing School Council operating funds for the remainder of the current fiscal year and going forward. School Council honoraria rates come out of the School Council operating funds provided annually by the Government of Yukon.</p>

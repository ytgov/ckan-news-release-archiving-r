<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, October 7, at 11 a.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,542 people.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Tuesday, September 29, to Monday, October 5, we tested 108 people at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) in Whitehorse.</p>

<p><strong>COVID alert app </strong></p>

<p>We are reviewing the current benefits and limitations of the Government of Canada’s COVID Alert app within the territory and how it is working in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The app uses Bluetooth to communicate with other devices when in close range. If your phone has been in the same location as a person diagnosed with COVID-19 who uses the app and has uploaded that information, you are anonymously advised of a possible exposure.</p>

<p>Yukoners who have downloaded the app and travelled outside Yukon should contact Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) for follow up if they receive an alert on their device.</p>

<p><strong>New testing options </strong></p>

<p>A new swish and spit, or gargle, COVID-19 test developed in BC may be used within Yukon in the near future. This test does not require a nasal swab and the gargle option is particularly useful for children.</p>

<p>Another tool under review is the Abbott ID NOW test, which is a portable rapid molecular test that can provide results within 15 minutes. This test was approved by Health Canada and Yukon anticipates receiving an allotment of 10 machines. More information on how the machines will be deployed will be provided as analysis proceeds.</p>

<p><strong>Thanksgiving</strong></p>

<p>Stay outside for gatherings as much as possible. You can gather with up to 50 people outside if you maintain physical distancing. Avoid hosting or attending any gathering if you are feeling unwell even if your symptoms are mild. Though your social bubble can include up to 15 people, indoor gatherings are limited to 10 people. If you are eating together, have a designated carver and server to limit spreading germs. Avoid sharing common items like glasses, cutlery, snack bowls and salt or pepper shakers. Set your table and chairs for physical distancing between people from different bubbles.</p>

<p>Always follow the Safe 6. Avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement statistics </strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has received 887 complaints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to self-isolate: 496</li>

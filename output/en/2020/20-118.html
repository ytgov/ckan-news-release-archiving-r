<p>Premier Sandy Silver today announced the appointment of Manon Moreau as the president of the Yukon Liquor Corporation and Lotteries Yukon, and Paul McConnell as the deputy minister for the Department of Highways and Public Works.</p>

<p>McConnell and Moreau will begin in their new roles on July 4.</p>

<p>Moreau moved to Yukon in 1997 to work for the federal government before moving to the Government of Yukon in 2000. She has held a variety of positions in the Government of Yukon public service and was also the director of governance at Kwanlin Dün First Nation in 2009.  She was the director of corporate policy and planning with the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources before becoming the assistant deputy minister of sustainable resources in 2017 where she led the final approvals of the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan. She sat on the Yukon Hospital Corporation board this past year as the public service member. Moreau has a bachelor of arts from the University of Alberta and a master of arts in political science from the University of Victoria.</p>

<p>Since February 2019, McConnell has been President of the Yukon Liquor Corporation and Lotteries Yukon. Previous to that he has held multiple senior leadership positions in the Department of Highways and Public Works, including assistant deputy minister of the property management division, assistant deputy minister of the transportation division, and acting deputy minister of the department from November 2016 to December 2017. Before joining the Government of Yukon, McConnell had a 25 year career with the RCMP, and performed a wide range of roles throughout western and northern Canada and was the Criminal Operations Officer for Yukon from 2010 to 2015.</p>

<p>Jaime Pitfield will retire as deputy minister for the Department on Highways and Public Works on July 3.</p>

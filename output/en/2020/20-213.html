<p>Concern continues to rise around the number of opioid related deaths in Yukon. Since January 2020, 13 individuals have died as a result of drug overdoses, 11 of which can be directly linked to opioids. The numbers were jointly released today by Yukon’s Chief Coroner Heather Jones, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley and Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost.</p>

<p>The announcement comes with a caution to all drug users to be extremely cautious in what they are using and who they are buying from. In May this year, the coroner and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health issued a first warning, advising individuals not to use alone and to ensure they have a naloxone kit readily available.  </p>

<p>There are currently plans under way to expand drug testing and explore the possibility of a supervised consumption site in Yukon.</p>

<p>These deaths are heartbreaking. With each death, our community loses a son or a daughter, a neighbour or a colleague. People need to be aware about the dangers of illicit drug use and know that opioid use does not discriminate. This is a complex problem that we need to address as a community. This includes working to reduce the stigma around people who use drugs, which remains a significant barrier that prevents individuals, families and communities from getting help.</p>

<p>Given the number of deaths in only seven months and the continued efforts we have undertaken to caution people, we have reached another level of crisis. We have to think differently about how we meet the needs of this segment of our population to keep them safe and to keep those at risk alive.</p>

<p>The foremost objective of Yukon RCMP is to keep Yukoners safe, particularly our most vulnerable population. While enforcement is a key component in keeping our community safe from drug traffickers, it can only go so far. This is a bigger issue beyond simple law enforcement that requires a community approach that also includes prevention, education and harm reduction.</p>

<p>Premier Silver has announced an economic stimulus package to support local workers and businesses impacted by COVID-19. This money is being made available to help offset the negative impacts of the evolving global situation.</p>

<p>The stimulus package will:</p>

<ul>
<li>support Yukon workers through a COVID-19 related 14-day isolation with paid sick leave;</li>
	<li>Reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 by establishing a grant program to address certain expenses related to cancelled events;</li>
	<li>stimulate business and the tourism industry by waiving, reimbursing or delaying government fee collection, such as airport landing fees;</li>
	<li>relieve financial pressures by deferring Workers' Compensation Health and Safety premium payments and reimburse those paid up-front, waive penalties and interest (with approval by the Board);</li>
	<li>support the tourism industry with enhanced local advertising efforts;</li>
	<li>support the cultural industry by honouring transfer payment agreements considering COVID-19 related impacts; and</li>
	<li>continue to monitor the economic impacts of COVID-19 by establishing a Business Advisory Council to gather information and share with government.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government of Yukon will continue to work closely with the Government of Canada to access all available federal funding, and to maximize existing funds to keep Yukoners working and Yukon projects going ahead.</p>

<p>Yukon Ministers continue to work with federal counterpoints on all aspects of this situation. In the last week, there have been frequent conversations between the Prime Minister, Premiers, Ministers of Health, Public Safety, Tourism and Culture, Education, and Finance. Ongoing meetings are happening between officials at all levels of government, including regular health updates. The Government of Yukon supports the continued collaboration between jurisdictions on measures that support the needs of all regions.</p>

<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health continues to lead the territory’s public health response. Our government continues to follow the recommendations of that office on all health issues related to COVID-19.</p>

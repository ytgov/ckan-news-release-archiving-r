<p>Yukon students, families and school staff were recently asked to share their experiences and perspectives with learning during the end of the 2019–20 school year. A summary of survey results is now available on <a href="https://engageyukon.ca/en/2020/student-learning-during-pandemic">engageyukon.ca.  </a> </p>

<p>The Government of Yukon asked students, families and school staff to share what worked well and what didn’t while face-to-face classes were suspended. The feedback from the survey will help identify which activities and supports were effective while students learned away from school and will support staff in planning learning opportunities and ongoing instruction for students for the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>Follow up surveys will also be conducted during the 2020–21 school year to check in on the effectiveness of learning activities and supports and to adapt learning opportunities as needed.</p>

<p>Thank you to the many students, families and school staff who took the time to share their thoughts with us about their experiences learning during the end of the 2019–20 school year. Hearing the perspectives of students, families and school staff will help to ensure we are meeting the needs of students and supporting educators as we adapt learning during the course of the pandemic.</p>

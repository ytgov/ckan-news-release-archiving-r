<p>The Government of Yukon would like to issue key updates and reminders as hunters prepare for the 2020 hunting season.</p>

<p><strong>Permit Hunt Authorization (PHA) lottery</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://yukon.ca/puneet_node/14795">The final list of permit holders is now available online.</a></p>

<p>Forty-four permits were returned. The Government of Yukon completed five rounds of the reissuance process and is pleased to have issued all permits.</p>

<p>In total, there were 6,079 applications for 270 PHA permits covering six species.</p>

<p>Statistics for the 2020 PHA lottery are now online showing the distribution of years applied and the number of applications for each hunt code, for each species.</p>

<p><strong>Hunting during COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>All hunters must follow the latest orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health when planning their hunt, including the <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/borders-and-travel-covid-19/travel-within-yukon-communities">guidelines on travel to Yukon communities</a>. The most up-to-date information is available online at <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information">Yukon.ca/covid-19</a>. Hunters are also encouraged to follow the travel advisories from First Nations governments and communities on the Council of Yukon First Nations <a href="https://www.cyfn.ca/covid-19/">website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Harvest reports and mandatory submissions</strong></p>

<p>For most species, hunters report their harvest no later than 15 days after the end of the month in which the animal was taken. Hunters are encouraged to report their harvest by calling Client Services at 867-667-5652 or toll free in Yukon 1-800-661-0408, ext. 5652 during regular business hours.</p>

<p>When calling, hunters will receive further guidance on how to submit any mandatory biological submissions.</p>

<p><strong>Online (Turn and Polluters) TIPP reporting</strong></p>

<p>The new-and-improved web reporting service for Turn in Poach and Polluters (TIPP) is now available. This service was created to report witnessed violations of fishing, hunting, trapping or environmental laws, or injured or dead wildlife. This online service is not monitored evenings, weekends or on statutory holidays. For dangerous wildlife encounters and other situations that need immediate assistance, call the TIPP line at 1-800-661-0525.</p>

<p><strong>Hunt respectfully</strong></p>

<p>We remind all hunters that conservation and cooperation should be a priority when out on the land. No matter where you hunt in Yukon, you are on a First Nation’s or Inuvialuit traditional territory. Respect the land, other hunters and the wildlife that is being harvested. Keep a clean camp, pack out what is brought into the backcountry, stay on established trails and don’t use cabins without permission.</p>

<p><strong>Get the new hunt wisely guide</strong></p>

<p>Hunters are encourages to get a copy of the Yukon hunting regulations summary booklet. New this year is the hunt wisely guidebook, which includes hunter ethics, essential gear, firearm safety, field dressing methods and more. Copies of both booklets are available online or at any Department of Environment office.</p>

<p>Hunting is different during COVID-19. Hunters need to take additional precautions to be sure they are travelling safely through Yukon communities and to follow the Safe 6. We recognize that being outdoors and connecting with the land is important for our mental and physical health, particularly during this pandemic. I wish all hunters a safe and successful hunting season.</p>

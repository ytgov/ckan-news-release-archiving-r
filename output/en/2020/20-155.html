<p>Today the Government of Yukon and the Chief Medical Officer of Health provided a progress update on easing COVID-19 restrictions in Yukon. Premier Silver and Dr. Hanley confirmed that if conditions continue trending positively Yukon is on track to begin Phase II on July 1.</p>

<p>Since the transition to Phase I of A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions on May 15, Yukoners have seen a gradual shift in COVID-19 related restrictions. This includes the reopening of personal services, dine-in restaurants opening at 50 per cent capacity and day cares, day camps and recreational centres approved to operate. New guidelines are in place effective today that describe how to travel responsibly within Yukon and respect the wishes of communities and First Nations. Next week, territorial parks and campgrounds will open for the summer.</p>

<p>Once the transition to Phase II begins, additional restrictions will be lifted throughout July. This includes lifting travel restrictions between Yukon and British Columbia, which will allow for the free movement of Yukon and BC residents back and forth, with no requirement for 14-day self-isolation.</p>

<p>Decisions about how and when to move forwards or backwards through each phase of the plan continue to be guided by careful risk assessments and the six “criteria for transitioning between phases” including community engagement and public health capacity such as the capacity to contact trace and maintain fast testing turn around time.</p>

<p>Monitoring the status of the virus in neighbouring jurisdictions will continue to determine if it is safe to further lift restrictions. British Columbia has seen a significant decrease in cases of COVID-19 and continued progress containing the virus and flattening the curve, paving the way for the gradual lifting of some border restrictions.</p>

<p>We recognize the impact that COVID-19 restrictions are having on our physical, emotional and economic wellbeing and are striving to reach the proper balance between public safety and Yukoners’ desire to resume their lives. We are confident in our health care capacity, our ability to test and our ability to track and contain this virus. It is that confidence, and all the skills we have gained in the past two months, that allow us to begin moving into Phase II of this plan.</p>

<p>British Columbia has shown great success in managing COVID-19 within the province and based on their epidemiology, and ours, I am confident that this is a safe way for us to progress as we transition out of our cocoon. Looking at our overall health, I believe this is the right choice for the territory.</p>

        <p>There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.</p>

        <p>The six steps to staying safe are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.</p>

        <p>With no new cases since April 20, Yukon remains one of the least restricted parts of the country. A Path Forward is a gradual and phased approach to easing current restrictions in the territory.</p>

<p>Residential tenants who are under a health protection measure after June 25 or who need to breach their tenancy agreement because they are under a COVID-19 health protection order will continue to be protected from eviction.</p>

<p>As of July 1, all tenants must pay their rent in full as set in their tenancy agreements, unless they are prevented from doing so because they are subject to a health protection measure.</p>

<p>Tenants who owe unpaid rent from March 26 to July 1 because of COVID-19 loss of income or after<br>
	June 25, because they were under a health protection measure, have until December 31 to repay the outstanding amount. For people who are subject to a health protection measure such as self-isolation in accordance with the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s instructions, rental protection measures put in place on March 26, 2020 continue.</p>

<p>The order also prevents landlords from entering the rental unit of a tenant subject to a health protection measure unless it is an emergency. Additionally, tenants who are not able to pay their rent because of COVID-19 loss of income will still be able to end their tenancy with 30 days’ notice to their landlord. This frees up the rental unit to tenants who are able to cover rent.</p>

<p>Tenants and landlords are encouraged to contact the Residential Tenancies Offices for more information by phone at 867-667-5944 or toll-free in Yukon at 1-800-661-0408 extension 5944, or by email at <a href="mailto:rto@gov.yk.ca">rto@gov.yk.ca</a></p>

<p>A variety of territorial and federal programs are currently in place to support individuals who are experiencing financial impacts as a result of COVID-19. Information about available supports can be found at Yukon.ca/covid-19.</p>

<p>We continue to provide safeguards for tenants who may have to self-isolate and follow health protection orders while the emergency order is in effect. As restrictions lift, we know that it will take time for some businesses to reopen and rehire staff. We hope that with this deadline, affected tenants will have enough time to earn the income to pay any overdue rent.   </p>

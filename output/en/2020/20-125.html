<p>The Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley, and Yukon's Chief Coroner Heather Jones are cautioning Yukon residents around drug use after seven drug-related deaths since January 2020: three deaths in March and April are confirmed as fentanyl-related, while three deaths from January and February are still awaiting toxicology confirmation of drug content.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic compounds the ongoing public health crisis related to high rates of illicit drug overdose and deaths, as well as acute harms from substance use. There are concerns that the street supply is becoming even more unpredictable as regular supply channels are disrupted, and supports for people who use drugs are difficult to access.</p>

<p>Each of these recent deaths mean another life extinguished too soon and another family left to grieve. These tragedies are a brutal reminder that fentanyl and other dangerous drugs remain within easy reach. We have no way of knowing if these deaths would have happened even without COVID 19 but it does offer us the opportunity to remind individuals to not use alone and to have a naloxone kit handy. It’s also an opportunity to remind Yukoners of the excellent Opioid Treatment Services available at the Referred Care Clinic. Anyone can access the OTS clinic, no referral is needed. Any drug death is a loss and at this time, when families cannot gather, it is doubly sad.</p>

<p>Yukon Coroner’s Service has seen a significant increase in accidental illicit drug-related deaths over the past few months. The numbers have more than doubled from those seen in the same 2019 period. This is cause for real concern, which is shared by the Chief Medical Officer of Health.  We join him in reminding Yukoners to access the many resources available. Every death of a Yukoner has impact and together we can work to prevent unnecessary heartbreak and pain in our communities.</p>

<p>Ongoing enforcement efforts by the Yukon RCMP's Crime Reduction Unit continues to indicate that a variety of 'hard' drugs, including fentanyl, are making their way into the illicit supply chain. The RCMP is fully supportive of Yukon Health's harm reduction program and remains committed to working with Health Authorities and NGO's in the timely sharing of information impacting those most vulnerable to the illicit drug trade.</p>

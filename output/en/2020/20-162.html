<p>Yukon resident hunters can apply for a Special Guide Licence (SGL) from June 5 to 18, 2020.</p>

<p>A Yukon resident with a valid big game hunting licence who obtains an SGL may guide a non-resident Canadian hunter for moose, caribou or bison. They may also apply for weighting only, which will improve their chances in future SGL lotteries. </p>

<p>All hunters must follow the latest orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health when planning their hunt, including the Travel within Yukon guidelines. Non-residents who are not already in the territory are advised they will need to comply with <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19/border-enforcement-during-covid-19">border restrictions</a> and self-isolation requirements.</p>

<p>This year, successful applicants can decline having a licence issued if the non-resident is unable to enter Yukon due to travel restrictions. Successful applicants will be notified by email and must then request their SGL licence to be issued by contacting the Department of Environment. Once a licence is issued, it cannot be returned. Successful applicants should confirm that the non-resident hunter is eligible to enter Yukon in advance of requesting the issuance of licences. If the successful applicants do not request and obtain their licences, both applicants will be eligible to apply for the lottery next year and appropriate weighting will be applied to the resident’s licensing history.</p>

<p>There are 125 special guide licences available and hunters can apply <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/special-guide-licence">online</a>.</p>

<p>Outdoor recreation is important for Yukoners’ mental and physical health and wellness at all times, including during this pandemic. This year’s Special Guide Licence lottery will provide non-residents who are staying with family in Yukon an opportunity to hunt and potentially provide high-quality food for their family. As always, hunters should take only what they need, be respectful of the land and other hunters, and use all that they take, but they should also take extra precautions and follow the latest public health recommendations to ensure a safe and responsible hunting season.</p>

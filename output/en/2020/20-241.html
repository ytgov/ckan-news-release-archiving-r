<p><em>Please note that the failure to self-isolate count has been updated, and we have added a clarification to the "Other approved jurisdictions"</em> category<em>. </em></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, August 26, at 3 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 2,459 people.</p>

<p><strong>Respiratory Assessment Centre</strong></p>

<p>From Wednesday, August 19, to Tuesday, August 25, we tested 116 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse.</p>

<p><strong>Contact sports guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Guidelines for contact sports are now on Yukon.ca. By adapting the way we play contact sports to reduce the risk of COVID-19 we can get back on the ice, field and court. The new guidelines apply to children and adult leagues and supplement the Government of Yukon’s existing <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/industry-operating-guidelines-covid-19/sport-and-recreation">sport and recreation guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Holding a gathering guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Guidelines for holding organized gatherings as well as social gatherings are now online. Organized gatherings are seated events in a rented venue, such as weddings, celebrations of life and cultural events. You can have up to 50 people at an organized event indoors and up to 100 people outdoors. All rental venues need to have an operational plan and guests and organizers need to follow the plan.</p>

<p>Social gatherings are events in private homes or public spaces, such as birthday celebrations, retirement parties and backyard barbecues. You can have up to 10 people indoors or 50 people outdoors for these sorts of gatherings.</p>

<p><strong>When to stay home</strong></p>

<p>Yukoners are reminded not to go to work or school if they’re feeling sick. They should check the Iist of COVID-19 symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete the online assessment tool and get tested if that’s recommended.</p>

<p>If someone in a family or household is unwell, the people they live with may go to work or school unless a health care provider has told them to stay home. This advice is the same if the person who’s unwell has been tested for COVID-19. </p>

<p><strong>Testing and self-isolation</strong></p>

<p>Anyone who does not feel well should check the COVID-19 list of symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete the online assessment tool and get tested if it’s recommended.</p>

<p>Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate and use the online self-assessment tool at Yukon.ca, call 811 or contact their health care provider. They’ll receive guidance from a health care provider according to their individual circumstances. There are many unique situations that require guidance from public health officials.</p>

<p>People who are tested for COVID-19 should continue to self-isolate until they receive their test result or until a health care provider advises them they no longer need to.</p>

<p>People returning to or travelling into Yukon from anywhere except British Columbia, the Northwest Territories or Nunavut must self-isolate for a full 14 days, regardless of testing.</p>

<p>We’re grateful to everyone who takes getting tested and self-isolation seriously and helps to reduce the risk of infection in their community.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting possible <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> offences </strong></p>

<p>If anyone has concerns that someone is violating a <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA) Order, they can now fill in a <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/cema-report">form on Yukon.ca</a>. People can also call the enforcement line at 1-877-374-0425.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement statistics </strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has received 617 complaints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to self-isolate: 346</li>
	<li>Social gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 15</li>
	<li>Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on the designated route: 236</li>
	<li>Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 7</li>
	<li>Failure to abide by a declaration form or not permitted entry into Yukon: 11</li>
	<li>Other: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been six charges laid under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> (CEMA).</p>

<p>A total of 37,042 travellers have come into Yukon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resident travellers: 6,990</li>
	<li>BC residents: 5,164</li>
	<li>NWT residents: 145</li>
	<li>Other approved jurisdictions: 219*</li>
	<li>Non-residents staying: 8,361</li>
	<li>Non-residents transiting: 16,145</li>
	<li>Other: 18</li>
</ul>
<p>* Due to the fact that the way we’ve collected traveller data has changed since we started collecting statistics, the "Other approved jurisdictions" category has been used to categorize travellers that did not fall into an existing category. We’re reviewing how we collect and categorize statistics to maintain accuracy, and will make adjustments as necessary.</p>

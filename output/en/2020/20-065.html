<p>Canada and the United States are temporarily restricting all non-essential travel across its borders to limit the spread of COVID-19. This is a precautionary measure, in line with the directions on social distancing that are being given by health officials across the country.  </p>

<p>Starting at 9 p.m. PDT Friday, March 20, 2020, discretionary, recreational and tourist travel between Canada and the US will no longer be allowed, including Yukon-Alaska border crossings. This will last for 30 days and means Yukoners will not be able to cross the border for recreational activities such as skiing.</p>

<p><strong>Essential supply chains and workers</strong></p>

<p>Essential supply chains and movement of goods and workers will not be impacted. These supply chains, including trucking, ensure that food, fuel, and life-saving medicines reach people on both sides of the border. Americans and Canadians, can also cross the land border to do essential work or for other urgent or essential reasons. This includes workers in mining, healthcare and emergency response.</p>

<p><strong>What this means for Yukoners </strong></p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has been working closely with the Government of Canada and other provinces and territories, with the specific needs of Yukoners in mind.</p>

<p>Some examples* of essential travel between Yukon and Alaska include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canadian residents living in Yukon and returning to Canada, including US citizens who normally live in Canada;</li>
	<li>US citizens seeking access to the following services based in Yukon:
		<ul>
<li>Emergency and routine medical and dental care;</li>
			<li>Veterinarian care for pets (with appropriate documentation for animals);</li>
			<li>Automobile servicing and repair; and</li>
			<li>Access to essential goods, like groceries and medicine.</li>
		</ul>
</li>
	<li>US healthcare professionals who have been called on to meet demands in the Yukon healthcare system;</li>
	<li>US citizens who are employed in Canada and are crossing the border for purposes of returning to work;</li>
	<li>US citizens who own real property or other assets in Canada and are crossing the border for purposes of required maintenance or other stewardship of those assets;</li>
	<li>Ground medical transportation operated by Canadian or US authorities;</li>
	<li>Canadian or US emergency response personnel, including but not limited to fire rescue;</li>
	<li>Canadian or US highway maintenance crews;</li>
	<li>All commercial transportation, including but not limited to the movement of essential goods like fuel, medical supplies, construction and industrial equipment and materials, alcoholic beverages and food.</li>
</ul>
<p> *This is a non-exhaustive list.</p>

<p>Anyone coming across the border will still be subject to federal guidance on self-isolation and monitoring.</p>

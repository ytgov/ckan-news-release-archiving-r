<p><em>The hours for the border crossings have been updated in this news release.</em></p>

<p>As of 8 a.m. on Monday, April 6, Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) Enforcement Officers have been placed at Yukon borders and at the Whitehorse airport as a measure to ensure that all travellers have the information they need to keep themselves and Yukoners safe from the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>These Government of Yukon enforcement officers will be collecting contact information of all travellers coming through Yukon or returning home, details of their 14-day self-isolation plans, and declarations of any symptoms of COVID-19. This information will allow CEMA Enforcement Officers to follow up and ensure that travellers are following self-isolation rules.</p>

<p>CEMA Enforcement Officers will be stationed at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Weigh scales on the Alaska Highway south of Watson Lake</li>
	<li>Weigh scales at the junction of the Alaska Highway and the Stewart-Cassiar Highway</li>
	<li>Whitehorse airport</li>
</ul>
<p>The CEMA Enforcement Officers are also coordinating support for these measures with Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and officials in the Northwest Territories (NWT) for the following border crossings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fraser, BC border crossing</li>
	<li>Pleasant Camp, BC border crossing</li>
	<li>Beaver Creek border crossing</li>
	<li>Yukon-NWT border on the Dempster Highway</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone traveling into or through Yukon is required to self-isolate for 14 days. People transiting through Yukon to Alaska, NWT or other parts of Canada are required to complete their transit in Yukon within 24 hours of their entry, and shall avoid unnecessary contact with others when they stop for food or fuel. All Yukoners are reminded to practice safe physical distancing and to stay two metres (six feet) away from people outside of their household, wash their hands regularly, and cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue.</p>

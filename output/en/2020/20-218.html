<p>The Government of Yukon has partnered with the Canadian Index of Wellbeing and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to undertake a comprehensive study of wellbeing in Yukon.</p>

<p>As Yukon begins transitioning into Phase 3 of the pandemic response, all Yukoners are being called on to complete the Yukon Community Wellbeing survey to measure territorial wellbeing and better understand the local impacts of COVID-19. The survey opened on Monday and responses will be collected throughout the next four weeks, closing in early September.</p>

<p>The results of the Community Wellbeing Survey will provide a territory-wide snapshot of Yukoners’ wellbeing. The survey will generate the needed data to support informed decision making to best meet the unique and changing needs of Yukoners with programs, services and supports tailored to the local context. The COVID-specific questions at the start of the survey will be used to inform next steps in the pandemic response.</p>

<p>Ensuring the voices of all Yukoners are reflected through this survey is essential. As a thank you for completing the survey, all respondents will be entered into a draw to receive one of three $500 prepaid Visa gift cards.</p>

<p>While Yukon communities are incredibly resilient, we know that responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on our overall wellbeing. This survey will help us identify some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic and the overall health response so far. This is a chance to hear directly from Yukoners about how things are going during these challenging times, and what we as government can do to improve wellbeing across the territory. I encourage all Yukoners to take the time to complete this important survey, as it will inform how we continue to manage the pandemic in a way that minimizes the impacts on individuals and communities.</p>

<p>Through our collective efforts, we have effectively contained the spread of COVID-19 in Yukon, but we know that our success has come with many unintended consequences to our wellbeing, both negative and in some instances positive. This survey and your participation in it is incredibly important. It represents one part of the approach we are taking to monitor the short and long terms impacts of the public health response and the many COVID closures that have been imposed since March. Your voice and your perceptions matter, so please take the time to complete this survey. The feedback we get will be used to inform our next steps in the pandemic response as we continue to keep COVID-19 contained with a minimum of harms to our social and economic wellbeing.</p>

<p class="SubHeading">We are extremely excited about our partnership with the Government of Yukon as we explore the wellbeing of the residents of Yukon, especially during this challenging time. We know from our work across the country that Canadians place quality of life at the top of their list of priorities for themselves, their families, and their communities. Beyond the economy, Canadians’ wellbeing is a function of many aspects of their lives, such as their connections with others, their sense of belonging, the benefits they derive from their leisure, and the quality of their environment. The results of the survey will provide insights into where inequities of wellbeing exist in the lives of Yukoners so that steps can be taken to ensure that everyone can thrive. <p></p></p>

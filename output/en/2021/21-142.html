<p>Yukon’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has now reached 76 per cent for first doses of the vaccine. As of May 17, 26,242 eligible Yukon adults have received their first dose of the vaccine and 23,236 have had their second dose.</p>

<p>Vaccine uptake is increasing in every age group with rates ranging from 65 per cent for first doses in those aged 18 to 29 years, to 90 per cent in those aged 70 and over. Seventy-two per cent of those aged 30 to 39 have received first doses; 75 per cent of those in the 40 to 49 age group, 77 per cent of those aged 50 to 59 and 83 per cent of those aged 60 to 69. 73 per cent of males 18 and over, and 78 per cent of females 18 and over have received their first vaccination. Second dose percentages are lower as the second doses must be administered a minimum of 28 days following the first dose.</p>

<p>A clinic in Whitehorse is open for residents age 18 and older to receive their first and second doses of the vaccine by appointment or by walk-in. The clinic is open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; on Wednesdays it is open from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Residents age 18 and older in rural communities can call their local clinics for an appointment or can receive a vaccination in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>Vaccination clinics for youth age 12 to 17 will begin soon, with first doses to be administered before the end of the school year. Youth vaccine clinics will be held in most communities and medical travel will be supported for those places where a youth clinic is not being held or for those who need it.</p>

<p>More than 75 per cent of eligible Yukon adults have now received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This is a milestone for our territory and all of Canada. The Yukon continues to lead the country in immunizations. We look forward to increasing our vaccination rates further as we make vaccines available to youth in the coming weeks. The more people get immunized, the safer our territory will be.</p>

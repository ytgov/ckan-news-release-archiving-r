<p>The Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott has declared a COVID-19 outbreak at Ghùch Tiâ Community School in Carcross. Classes impacted are the Kindergarten class (K–4) and the Grade 1/2/3 split. Students, teachers and staff linked to these classes are all directed to get tested, regardless of vaccination status.</p>

<p>Investigation into the transmission of recent cases in the community indicates a link to the classes at the school. Students and staff were directed earlier this week to self-isolate but are now being directed to get tested. Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) has provided information to affected classes.</p>

<p>Participants and attendees at two community events, which took place in the school, have also received notification from YCDC. These events were the Carcross Tagish First Nations Youth Night on Wednesday, September 22, and the Carcross Recreation Activities – Judo event, also on Wednesday, September 22. </p>

<p>There are currently 27 active cases of COVID-19 in the territory, with four confirmed cases identified since noon Wednesday, September 29. Three of these cases were in Carcross and one out of territory resident diagnosed in the Yukon.</p>

<p>With the declaration of another school outbreak, I want to emphasize a few important points. Until we have a vaccine for children, the best way to protect them is for the youth and adults around them to get vaccinated. This prevents infection. Once symptoms occur, you can only tell if it’s COVID-19 by getting tested – so get tested. If you test positive, you will be advised on the next steps in how to protect yourself and others will be able to know if they may have been exposed. We are now living with COVID-19 in Yukon, and it will take all of us taking these steps to keep the impact on ourselves, our communities and our healthcare system to a minimum.</p>

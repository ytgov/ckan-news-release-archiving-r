<p>The acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott has reported one new case of COVID-19 between noon on Wednesday, September 1 and noon on Friday, September 3. The number of active cases is currently at 22.  </p>

<p>Total number of confirmed Yukon cases since March 22, 2020: 694; 637 cases since June 1, including out of territory residents diagnosed in the Yukon and probable cases. Out of territory individuals who are diagnosed in the Yukon are counted in the active count but not in the Yukon total case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction.</p>

<p>For the new cases since noon on Wednesday, September 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>One case in Whitehorse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since March 22, 2020, 665 people have recovered. A total of eight people have died from COVID-19 since November 2020.  None of the people who have died in Yukon were fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>The Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health continues to monitor daily activity and as active cases and daily case counts have stabilized, information bulletins will be issued on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The number of cases will continue to be updated Monday through Friday online.</p>

<h2>Public exposure notice rescinded</h2>

<p>A public exposure notice issued on Tuesday, August 31, for Bees Kneez Bakpakers Hostel in Whitehorse has been rescinded. Further investigation has determined no link between an individual who is positive for COVID-19 and attendance at the hostel.</p>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online</a> to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre.

<p>Based on new recommendations from the acting Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Government of Yukon is loosening some public health measures.</p>

<p>The Yukon remains in a state of emergency in response to a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases and widespread community transmission. <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/news/state-emergency-declared-response-increased-spread-covid-19-yukon">New public health measures were introduced on November 8</a> to limit the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the territory’s health care system is not overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Proof of vaccination will continue to be required to access most <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/covid-19-vaccine/where-youll-have-show-proof-vaccination">designated settings</a> but as of December 4, proof of vaccination will no longer be required for faith-based gatherings or to access personal services, such as hair salons. Businesses and organizations can still choose to require that patrons show proof of vaccination.</p>

<p>In addition, as of December 4:</p>

<ul>
<li>proof of vaccination will no longer be required for sport and recreation activities for those under 19;</li>
	<li>indoor, organized gatherings will no longer be limited to 25 individuals but will continue to be limited to 50 per cent of the venue capacity with mask use still required;</li>
	<li>outdoor gatherings will no longer be limited to 50 individuals; and</li>
	<li>indoor personal gatherings will no longer be limited to two households.</li>
</ul>
<p>The acting Chief Medical Officer continues to recommend that:</p>

<ul>
<li>indoor personal gatherings be limited to two households as a best practice; and</li>
	<li>travel between communities, and between communities and Whitehorse, be avoided until further notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations are subject to change if COVID-19 cases or risks increase significantly. Yukoners are encouraged to continue to practise the Safe 6 and check Yukon.ca for the latest up-to-date information on COVID-19 in the territory.</p>

<p>Last month we declared a state of emergency and introduced new public health measures in response to an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases and widespread community transmission in our territory. We needed to take swift action to stop transmission and ensure our health care system was not overwhelmed. Since that time, we have seen an encouraging decrease in active cases and daily case counts, but we must remain vigilant. I want to thank all Yukoners for continuing to follow public health recommendations to keep our territory safe.</p>

<p>Updated modelling shows that the circuit breaker public health measures have been successful in flattening the case curve, but we are not out of the woods yet. The new Omicron variant is causing global concern and its impacts are not yet known. We must continue to be diligent, follow public health measures, practise the Safe 6, wear a mask and get vaccinated.</p>

<p><em>Please note the first quote is from Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna.</em></p>

<p><em>This is a joint news release with the Government of Canada and the City of Whitehorse.</em></p>

<p>Investing in local infrastructure supports the unique needs of northern communities. The governments of Canada and Yukon are taking decisive action to invest in community infrastructure and stabilize the economy across Canada, while first and foremost ensuring that the health and safety of all Canadians are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

<p>Today, Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, Yukon’s Minister of Community Services Richard Mostyn and City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis, announced $820,000 for safety improvements in school zones across the City of Whitehorse.</p>

<p>The City of Whitehorse will be improving pedestrian safety and calming traffic near several elementary schools with a variety of measures. Projects over the next two years will include a new sidewalk, zebra crosswalks, curb extensions, a mini-roundabout, a paved trail and LED pedestrian lights. </p>

<p>The Government of Canada is investing $820,000 in this project through the federal Gas Tax Fund (GTF), a permanent source of federal funding for infrastructure investments.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see the City of Whitehorse using its federal Gas Tax Fund for a project to protect children, our most precious resource. Municipalities have many priorities and ensuring pedestrian safety in school zones is a major one. The Government of Yukon is pleased to partner with the federal government in helping Yukon municipalities and First Nations access the Gas Tax Fund. The fund provides reliable funding for projects that improve the health and well-being of all Yukoners and create economic opportunity.</p>

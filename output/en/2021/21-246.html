<p>The Office of the Commissioner of Yukon is saddened to hear of the passing of Jack Cable, former Commissioner of Yukon.</p>

<p>Ivan John (Jack) Cable Q.C., was born in Hamilton, Ontario on August 17, 1934. Cable earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Toronto, a Master’s Degree in Business Administration at McMaster University and after working as a chemical engineer for 9 years, he obtained a Law Degree from the University of Western Ontario and was called to the Ontario bar in 1970.</p>

<p>He moved to Yukon in 1970, was called to the Yukon bar and joined the law firm of Nielsen, Hudson and Anton. Cable later became a partner with the firm of Lueck, Pitzel and Cable. He was appointed Queen’s Counsel by Canada, in recognition of his legal expertise.</p>

<p>In 1991, he served as president of the Yukon Energy Corporation and the Yukon Development Corporation. He was also a director of the Northern Canada Power Commission. Cable was elected as a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly in 1992. He retained his seat in the Assembly until 2000. Upon his retirement from politics, he was appointed 34th Commissioner of Yukon, serving until 2005.</p>

<p>Cable served his community in a variety of capacities. He was president of the Yukon Chamber of Commerce, director of the Yukon Science Institute, and a member of the Advisory Board of the Salvation Army Adult Residential Centre. He also helped found the Recycle Organics Together Society and the Boreal Alternate Energy Centre, a society that helped develop wind-powered electrical generation in Yukon. He belonged to the Learning Disabilities Association of Yukon, the Association of Professional Engineers of the Yukon, and the Law Society of the Yukon. Jack was an active member of the Royal Canadian Legion. He received the Order of Yukon in 2020.</p>

<p>The Office of the Commissioner of Yukon sends its love and prayers to his wife Faye, his children Susan, Jennifer, Andrew and Daniel, his family and all his friends.</p>

<p><em>Please note this statement has been updated and all those who have received a first dose by February 6, will receive their second dose of vaccine to ensure their full protection, the updated date includes the Saturday, February 6 clinic in Mayo.</em></p>

<p>Premier Sandy Silver and Minister Pauline Frost have released the following statement:</p>

<p>“On Friday, January 29, Moderna announced a reduction in their next vaccine shipment to Canada, which is scheduled for between February 4 and 10.  The Government of Canada has notified our government that our next shipment of vaccine will be reduced by 37 per cent, from 7,200 doses to 4,500 doses. It is anticipated that our fourth shipment scheduled for late February will also be reduced from 7,200 to 4,500.  Yukon is one of many jurisdictions in Canada and around the world that will see reduced shipments of the COVID-19 vaccine in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the reduced vaccine availability, mobile clinics scheduled for rural communities this week will continue, as will the clinic for those age 60 and older in Whitehorse. Work is also underway to schedule the second dose for all individuals who have received their first dose, starting with the residents and staff of our long-term care homes.</p>

<p>These smaller shipments will impact the opening of the vaccine clinic for the general population in Whitehorse, which had been scheduled for February 10, 2021. We will have more information to share in the coming days about the opening of the clinic to those age 18 and older in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>We remain committed to a safe and effective roll out of the vaccine delivery to all Yukon citizens. All those who have received a first dose by February 6, will receive their second dose of vaccine to ensure their full protection. We want to assure rural residents that their second doses are protected, and we will be returning to each community throughout February and the first two weeks of March.</p>

<p>Yukon’s vaccine rollout schedule was designed to be flexible based on vaccine availability. The supply of vaccines remains the responsibility of the federal government and we continue to receive assurances that Yukon will receive its full allotment of doses before March 31, 2021.</p>

<p>To date, the information that we have received still means that all Yukon citizens who would like to be immunized will be able to receive the vaccine by the end of April 2021.</p>

<p>We want to thank our mobile immunizations teams, Balto and Togo, as well as the team at the Whitehorse clinic for all their efforts to ensure Yukoners are able to get their shots in a safe and efficient manner. We have come a long way over the past 11 months and we must continue to be patient and vigilant as the vaccine rollout continues. Continue practicing the Safe 6, mask up, and look after each other.”</p>

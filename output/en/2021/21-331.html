<p>The Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliot has confirmed a positive COVID-19 case at Porter Creek Secondary School. Dr. Elliot has directed students in four Grade 9 and 10 classes at the school to self monitor or self isolate depending on their vaccination status, and family members of the affected classes were notified Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) is working closely with the school to perform contact tracing and ensure all necessary measures are in place to protect students and staff.</p>

<p>Vaccination status is playing an important role in our continued response to COVID-19. Those who are fully vaccinated and not immunocompromised are being asked to only self monitor for symptoms until September 17. People who are not vaccinated, only partially vaccinated or are immunocompromised are being asked to self isolate until September 13 and then self-monitor for symptoms until September 17.</p>

<p>We have been expecting to see cases within the schools this fall and we have built our responses accordingly. We have worked with the Department of Education to ensure that all schools are prepared for a case within their school community and are pleased with the collaboration. YCDC is contacting anyone directly who may be a close contact of the identified case and is providing one to one direction on who needs to self isolate or self monitor. I can’t stress enough how the risks of spread are higher for anyone who are not vaccinated.</p>

<p>The health and safety of students and staff is our first priority. We know that keeping schools open and available to students is good for their well-being, and our schools are prepared to adapt to these situations based on their Operational Plans, including how to support students with continued learning from home. To keep our schools safe, each of us has our part to contribute, whether we are staying home when sick, choosing to wear a mask in crowded spaces or ensuring those who can get vaccinated are doing so. Each of these measures adds an additional layer of safety to help protect Yukoners.</p>

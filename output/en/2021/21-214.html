<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting 31 new cases of COVID-19 since June 30, 2021. This brings the active case count to 146 with reported recoveries.</p>

<p>Yukon’s total case count since March 22, 2020: 388; 303 cases since June 1, 2021.</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on June 30, 2021:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thirty-one confirmed cases.</li>
	<li>Seventeen cases in Whitehorse, five cases in rural communities, six pending confirmation and three out of territory residents currently in Yukon.</li>
	<li>One hundred sixty individuals in the most recent outbreak have recovered.</li>
	<li>Five deaths since November 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Long-term care homes limit visitors</h3>

<p>From July 2 to July 16, long-term care homes in Yukon will reduce the number of visitors permitted per resident, from six to two for indoor visits. All other guidelines remain unchanged. This step is being taken to protect all those who live in long-term care homes as Yukon experiences its first wave of COVID-19. To date there have been no cases of COVID-19 within any of Yukon’s homes.</p>

<h3>Recommendations for team sports</h3>

<p>There is an increased risk of COVID-19 spread while playing team sports. Consider limiting organized sport activities that do not allow players to be at least 2 metres (6 feet) apart. Vaccination is the best way for anyone eligible (or anyone aged 12 and older) to participate in sports. If you are participating in a team sport, follow public health advice on Yukon.ca to help reduce the risk of spread.</p>

<h3>Public exposure notice</h3>

<p>Exposure notification letters have gone to parents and staff of the young toddler group at Grow with Joy Childcare, Second Avenue location; and to the parents and staff of the older toddler group at Grow with Joy Fourth Avenue location advising that anyone at either daycare group on Wednesday, June 23, 2021, must self-isolate and monitor for symptoms until Wednesday, July 7, 2021.</p>

<p>Exposure notifications have also gone to residents of the Chilkoot Trail Inn. Anyone resident there between Monday, June 21 and Wednesday, June 30, 2021, or anyone visiting a resident is asked to monitor for symptoms and stay home if any occur. These people can seek testing at the COVID Testing and Assessment Centre.</p>

<h3>People with symptoms</h3>

<p>Testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever. People who are vaccinated may also rarely acquire COVID-19 and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online</a> for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or book online to arrange for testing at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/</a>. Drive-up testing is available in Whitehorse at the CTAC 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily at 49A Waterfront Place.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre.</p>

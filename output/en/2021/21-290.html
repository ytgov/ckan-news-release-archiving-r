<p>The acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jesse Kancir is reporting nine new cases of COVID-19 from 12 p.m. Wednesday, August 11, to 12 p.m. today. The number of active cases is currently at 45.  </p>

<p>Total number of confirmed Yukon cases since March 22, 2020: 645; 585 cases since June 1, including out of territory residents diagnosed in the Yukon and probable cases. Out of territory individuals who are diagnosed in the Yukon are counted in the active count but not in the Yukon total case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction.</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on August 11, there are nine new cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two cases are out of territory residents diagnosed in the Yukon.</li>
	<li>Three residents are from rural Yukon and four are from Whitehorse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since June 1, 2021, 534 people have recovered and six people have died, five of whom were unvaccinated and one was partially vaccinated. A total of eight people have died from COVID-19 since November 2020.</p>

<p>The Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health continues to monitor daily activity and as active cases decrease and daily case counts are stabilized, information bulletins may no longer be issued daily. The number of cases will continue to be updated Monday through Friday <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/case-counts-covid-19">online.</a></p>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>Immunizers continue to provide clinics in rural Yukon communities this week. <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/appointments">Book an appointment online.</a> They will be delivering both first and second doses of Pfizer for youth born in 2009 and up to the age of 17 and Moderna for people 18 and over. While appointments are recommended, walk-ins will be welcome.</p>

<p>Immunizers ask that if you have made an appointment and can’t attend to please let the health centre know so that vaccine is not wasted.</p>

<p>Testing continues to be a priority to enable health care responders to manage risk and outbreaks. Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online </a>to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre. Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online</a> for faster access to results.</p>

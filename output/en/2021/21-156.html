<p>Today, the first sitting of the 35th Yukon Legislative Assembly concluded. The Assembly opened with a Speech from the Throne outlining the government’s priorities for its new mandate.</p>

<p>Three new pieces of legislation received assent, including the 2021–22 Budget, which is focused on improving the lives of Yukoners and includes significant investments in housing, education, community infrastructure and renewable energy projects. The budget includes record capital expenditures of $434.3 million, 17 per cent higher than 2020–21. From over $30 million for lot development to $12 million for affordable housing projects and more than $70 million towards transportation infrastructure, this capital spending will provide increased opportunities for Yukon businesses to contribute to community infrastructure projects across the territory. </p>

<p>To support Yukon families and make their lives more affordable, the budget invests more than $25 million towards early learning initiatives. This includes $15 million to support the new universal childcare program for the Yukon that is putting more disposable income into the hands of families, saving them on average $700 per month per child. The <em>Act to Amend the Child Care Act (2021) </em>also received assent today relocating the Child Care Unit from the Department of Health and Social Services to the Department of Education to help ensure that early learning and childcare services are coordinated at all levels.</p>

<p>A government motion to establish a Special Committee on Electoral Reform passed during the spring sitting. The committee, which includes a representative from each of the three parties in the Legislative Assembly, will examine and engage Yukoners about electoral reform. The committee will submit a report to the Legislative Assembly on its findings by March 31, 2022.</p>

<p>Yukoners sent a clear message that all Members of the Legislative Assembly need to work together for the benefit of the territory. That is what my colleagues and I are committed to doing. We are very pleased to establish an all-party committee on electoral reform to find out what Yukoners want when it comes to our electoral system, and how to make it better. This year’s budget sets us on the path to recovery and makes life in the territory more affordable. Our new universal childcare program is putting more money in the pockets of Yukon families while more than $50 million will help address climate change and grow the Yukon’s green economy. The budget also includes a $15 million COVID-19 contingency to ensure we can continue to support Yukoners and Yukon businesses as we get on the path to recovery.</p>

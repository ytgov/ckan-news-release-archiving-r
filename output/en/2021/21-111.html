<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of Tuesday, April 20, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 77. Seventy-four people have recovered, one person has died and there are two active cases. We have tested 7,062 people.</p>

<h3>Vaccination rollout progress</h3>

<p>As of the end of the day Tuesday, April 20, there were 45,971 doses of the Moderna vaccine administered in Yukon. This number includes 25,216 first doses and 20,755 second doses.</p>

<p>By region, the percentage of residents who have received a first dose is: 72 per cent in North Yukon; 81 per cent in West Yukon; 54 per cent in Central Yukon; 59 per cent in Southeast Yukon; and 72 per cent in Whitehorse.</p>

Visit Yukon.ca for the latest vaccination data and progress reporting.</p>

<p>A clinic in Whitehorse is open for residents age 18 and older to receive their first and second doses of the vaccine by appointment or by walk-in.</p>

<p>The third round of mobile vaccination tours to Yukon communities is complete. Residents age 18 and older can call their local health centre for an appointment or can receive a vaccination in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>To book an appointment and find more information, visit <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/this-is-our-shot">https://yukon.ca/en/this-is-our-shot</a>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>From Wednesday, April 14, to Tuesday April 20, 43 people were tested at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre<strong>. </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre</a> is open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday. Anyone experiencing severe symptoms and requiring immediate assistance can go to the Whitehorse General Hospital Emergency Department, a community hospital or health centre.</p>

<h3>Long term care changes</h3>

<p>Long term care homes are engaging with residents and families to develop a plan for safe community outings and an increased number of visitors for residents at the homes. The goal is to implement these changes the week of May 3.</p>

<h3>Testing for returning students and seasonal workers</h3>

<p>Vaccinations will be made available to all returning students and seasonal workers who are arriving in Yukon and wish to be immunized while in self-isolation. Students and seasonal workers between the ages of 18 to 29 will be granted permission to leave self-isolation to receive their vaccination. Tourists or visitors to the territory who cannot show proof of residency or employment will not be eligible to take part in this program.</p>

<p>Individuals will be required to book a COVID-19 test before being vaccinated. Individuals can expect to have their results within 15 minutes. If your test is negative, staff at the testing centre will book a same-day vaccine appointment for you. Proof of a same-day negative COVID-19 test must be presented at the vaccination clinic. Visit Yukon.ca for more details.</p>

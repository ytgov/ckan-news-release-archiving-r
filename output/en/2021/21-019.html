<p>The Government of Yukon is hiring more educators and has increased funding for tutoring programs to support students for the remainder of the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>The Department of Education is currently in the process of hiring 11 additional educators to support the three Whitehorse high schools that are providing half-day in-class programming as well as the Wood Street Centre and 12 educators to support elementary and rural schools. Staff will be deployed in various positions to support students, including success coaches, learning assistance teachers and blended learning and counselling supports.</p>

<p>An additional $150,000 in funding support has also been made available to schools, organizations and Yukon First Nations governments for tutoring programs to enhance supports for students.</p>

<p>Resources needed to support student learning continue to be monitored, while school operations and programming has been adapted to meet health and safety guidelines during the pandemic. The Government of Yukon has heard from students, families and school staff through its Learning during COVID-19 surveys, which provided additional feedback to regular assessment and reporting on student learning by educators. The results of the second Learning during COVID-19 survey are now available on engageyukon.ca.</p>

<p>A student at Porter Creek Senior Secondary School (PCSS) is one of two new cases of COVID-19 announced today by Yukon’s Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott.</p>

<p>There are now 15 active cases in the territory. Dr. Elliott confirms that eight of these are now confirmed as the P.1 (Gamma) variant of concern. The P1 variant is known to spread more quickly among unvaccinated individuals. Others have yet to be confirmed. Yukon’s total case count is 98.</p>

<p>For the new cases today:</p>

<ul>
<li>The PCSS prom ceremony, scheduled for June 12, has been cancelled. The Department of Education will work with the graduation committee to reschedule the event when it safe to do so.</li>
	<li>Students in the Porter Creek graduating class are advised to self-isolate, self-monitor for symptoms and seek testing if symptomatic.</li>
	<li>Further direction will be provided to the school and parents about any further recommendations by Wednesday, June 16 at the latest.</li>
	<li>Letters were sent to parents and guardians of students: ​
		<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://yukon.ca/puneet_node/17319">aged 12 and older in all other Yukon schools</a>; and</li>
			<li>at <a href="https://yukon.ca/puneet_node/17319">Porter Creek Secondary School</a>.  </li>
		</ul>
</li>
	<li>Students involved in graduation events at all three Whitehorse high schools are encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms and get tested if symptomatic.</li>
	<li>Case 97 and 98 are both Whitehorse residents, linked to previously announced cases. Both are isolating and recovering at home.</li>
</ul>
<h3>People with symptoms</h3>

<p>With current active cases in Yukon, testing for COVID infection is more important than ever in order to identify possible community spread. People who are vaccinated may acquire COVID-19 in rare circumstances and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be accessed online for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should self-isolate and call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or book on-line to arrange for testing at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/.&amp;nbsp">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/.&amp;nbsp</a>;</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre.</p>

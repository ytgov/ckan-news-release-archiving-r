<p>The Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting nine new cases of COVID-19 from 12 p.m. Friday, August 6, to 12 p.m. today. The number of active cases is currently at 44.  </p>

<p>Total number of confirmed Yukon cases since March 22, 2020: 633; 571 cases since June 1, including out of territory residents diagnosed in Yukon and probable cases. Out of territory individuals who are diagnosed in Yukon are counted in the active count but not in the case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction.<br><br>
	For the new cases since 12 p.m. on Friday, August 6, there are nine new cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>7 cases in Whitehorse, 2 in rural Yukon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Public exposure notification</h2>

<p>People may have been exposed to COVID-19 infection if they were at the following location:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kopper King Tavern, Whitehorse<br>
		Tuesday, August 3, 2021<br>
		4:30 p.m. to closing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms and testing</h2>

<p>Anyone who was at either of these locations and has symptoms of COVID-19 should get tested, arrange to get tested either by phoning 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/appointments">booking a test online.</a></p>

<p>Rural Yukon residents should contact their community health centre to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>Since June 1, 2021, 521 people have recovered and six people have died, five of whom were unvaccinated and one was partially vaccinated. A total of eight people have died from COVID-19 since November 2020.</p>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>Immunizers continue to provide clinics in rural Yukon communities this week. <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/appointments">Book an appointment online</a>. They will be providing both first and second dose Pfizer for youth born in 2009 and up to the age of 17 and first and second doses of Moderna for those 18 and over. While appointments are recommended, walk-ins will be welcome.</p>

<p>Immunizers ask that if you have made an appointment and can’t attend to please let the health centre know so that vaccine is not wasted.</p>

<p>Testing continues to be a priority to enable health care responders to manage risk and outbreaks. Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online</a> to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre. Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online</a> for faster access to results.</p>

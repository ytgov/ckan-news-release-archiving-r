<p><em>Joint release with the Government of Canada</em></p>

<p> The Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon have reached an agreement on an extension to the Canada–Yukon Early Learning and Child Care Agreement.</p>

<p>Through the agreement, the Government of Canada is providing over $10.1 million in funding over four years to the Yukon to improve access to high quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning and child care programs and services. In addition, the Government of Canada is also making a one-time investment of nearly $2.5 million in 2021-2022 to support development of the Yukon’s local early childhood educator workforce with recruitment and retention efforts.</p>

<p>Under the 2021–2022 to 2024–2025 Canada–Yukon Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, the Yukon will allocate funding to further build universal access to early learning and child care for all Yukon families, including increasing the current subsidy system, and increase training and certification opportunities for early childhood educators and program operators. The current Yukon Early Learning and Child Care Funding Program reduces parent fees by up to $700 per child per month for full-time participation in licensed child care programs and provides a minimum wage of nearly $30 an hour to fully qualified educators.  </p>

<p>This four-year agreement builds on the commitments made in the Multilateral Early Learning and Child Care Framework and ensures that funding continues to be available to support early learning and child care programs and services for Yukon families until March 2025.</p>

<p>These investments support the Government of Canada and the Government of Yukon’s shared commitment to provide Yukon parents with access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning child care.</p>

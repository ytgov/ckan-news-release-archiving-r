<p>We are at a point in the pandemic that we have not been in before and one that we hoped we would not see. A rapidly escalating COVID-19 situation is developing in the Yukon and is threatening our health care system. We need to take immediate steps to break the cycle of widespread community transmission we are seeing right now and will likely continue to see over the coming days. It is more important than ever to get vaccinated and practise the Safe 6 plus 1.</p>

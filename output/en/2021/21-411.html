<p>Total number of confirmed cases in Yukon residents since March 2020: 858. Individuals who are diagnosed in the Yukon are counted in the active case count but not in the Yukon total case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction. Since March 2020, 797 individuals have recovered. There has been a total of 10 deaths.</p>

<p>For the new cases since noon on Friday, October 15: </p>

<ul>
<li>Two are out territory residents diagnosed in the Yukon.</li>
	<li>Twenty-two are from Whitehorse, including three at Victoria Gold.</li>

		Monday, October 11, 2021<br>
		Between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m.<br>
		 </li>
	<li>The Local Bar, 206 Jarvis Street, Whitehorse<br>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>The acting Chief Medical Officer of Health continues to remind everyone who has symptoms to get tested, no matter where they are located. Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online</a> to arrange for testing.

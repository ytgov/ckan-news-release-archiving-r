<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting 15 new cases of COVID-19 for today. This brings the active case count to 134 with reported recoveries. He is also strongly recommending that Yukoners take steps to limit contacts over the next four to six weeks.</p>

<p>Yukoners are being asked to:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Stick to six”: limit social gatherings to a maximum of six people indoors and out.</li>
	<li>Limit organized gatherings to 10 people indoors with masking, 20 outdoors with physical distancing. If possible, consider postponing events.</li>
	<li>In bars and restaurants, do not visit among tables, follow rules of the establishment, do not crowd the bar and when finished, go home.</li>
	<li>Do not go to work if you are sick or exhibiting any symptoms; at the workplace, follow handwashing, masking and distancing guidelines.</li>
	<li>Daycares: if you are not an essential or critical worker and you can keep your children at home, please do so.</li>
	<li>Check with communities when travelling to see what they are posting and limit social visits between communities.<br><br>
		Yukon’s total case count since March 22, 2020: 357</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p>For the new cases since noon on June 29:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fifteen confirmed cases.</li>
	<li>Seven cases in Whitehorse and eight cases in rural communities.</li>
	<li>Two hundred nineteen individuals in the most recent outbreak have recovered.</li>
	<li>Five deaths since November 2020.</li>
	<li>One case is a non Yukon resident, this case is included in the active case count, but not in the total case count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be no case update on July 1, 2021.</p>

<h2>Public exposure notice</h2>

<p>Exposure notification letters have gone to parents and staff of Little Dreamers Daycare in Whitehorse recommending that all children and staff who were present on either June 18 or June 25, 2021, self-isolate and monitor for symptoms until Friday, July 2, 2021, for the earlier date and Friday, July 9, 2021, for the later date. Note only those present on either of those days are considered to be at risk.</p>

<h2>People with symptoms</h2>

<p>Testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever. People who are vaccinated may also rarely acquire COVID-19 and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online</a> for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or book on-line to arrange for testing at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/.&amp;nbsp">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/.&amp;nbsp</a>; Drive-up testing is available in Whitehorse at the CTAC 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily at 49A Waterfront Place.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre.</p>

<p>We need to buckle down for the time being so we can catch our breath and start to bend the curve. For the next two, and possibly four weeks, I am asking you to do everything you can to reduce contacts with other people. Keeping social circles small with help limit this outbreak. Remember, stick to six!</p>

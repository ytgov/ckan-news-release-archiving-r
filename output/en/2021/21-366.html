<p>Many people who live with disabilities have marketable skills but require accommodations which are hard to fit into a traditional workplace. By funding self-employment initiatives people with budding businesses, or ongoing projects that need support, are able to work those into a sustainable business model. Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk who lives with Autism may be unable to fit in a traditional work space, but given the opportunity they can contribute something entirely new and equally if not more valuable to the community.</p>

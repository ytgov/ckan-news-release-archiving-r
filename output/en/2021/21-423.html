<p>Premier Sandy Silver has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“Earlier this afternoon, RCMP received reports of an active shooter in Faro. The RCMP’s response was quick and decisive, with support from Emergency Medical Services volunteers on the ground in Faro and the Yukon’s Emergency Measures Organization.</p>

<p>“The RCMP have confirmed that the suspect has been arrested and there is no longer a public safety threat for the community of Faro. At this time we know there are multiple victims. The RCMP are actively investigating the incident to confirm additional details.</p>

<p>“This is truly a tragic situation. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims. We stand with the people of Faro during this extremely difficult time.</p>

<p>“A coordinated, inter-agency response is ensuring critical supports are being provided to residents and emergency responders. Staff at Del Van Gorder School responded immediately to protect all students. Family and Children’s Services are working with Education officials to provide crisis response supports to the school community. Victims Services and the Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services are providing counselling and immediate assistance to the community.</p>

<p>"We have been in contact with the Town of Faro to offer any support that is needed.</p>

<p>"We thank all first responders and the RCMP for their rapid response and encourage patience as the RCMP continue to investigate the situation."</p>

<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting 22 new cases of COVID-19 for today. This brings the active case count to 111 with reported recoveries. Since June 4, 2021, all of the variant testing results received to date are positive for the Gamma (P.1) variant.</p>

<p>Yukon’s total case count: 264</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on June 24:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twenty-two confirmed cases.</li>
	<li>The majority of cases are in Whitehorse.</li>
	<li>Seventy-one individuals in the most recent outbreak have recovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>COVID-19 is being widely transmitted throughout Yukon, with recent cases having spread through large unorganized social gatherings. Yukoners are being strongly encouraged to limit social gatherings to six people. Out of the 14 communities, 12 of them are home to COVID-19 positive people.</p>

<h2>People with symptoms</h2>

<p>Testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever. People who are vaccinated may also rarely acquire COVID-19 and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain rapid, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online</a> for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or book on-line to arrange for testing at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/</a>. Drive-up testing is available in Whitehorse at the CTAC 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. daily at 49A Waterfront Place.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre.</p>

<p>It is time to take a pause and slow down on social gatherings. For now, I would like all Yukoners to limit informal gatherings to a small number, regardless of vaccination status.</p>

<p>We expect to see high daily numbers of cases for a while yet. This outbreak is mostly affecting unvaccinated adults, children, and youth, but even vaccinated people are at some risk. There is a high risk for spread of COVID-19 in any social gathering, and great care must be taken. Any organized gathering such as a wedding or funeral must adhere to <a href="https://yukon.ca/und/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/industry-operating-guidelines-covid-19/holding-gathering">current guidelines</a>. Unorganized social gatherings should for now be limited to no more than six adults. Limiting our contacts for the next two weeks will help us take a pause and assess where we are. Our public health system is significantly challenged right now and this measure will allow us to address where we are seeing our greatest risk.</p>

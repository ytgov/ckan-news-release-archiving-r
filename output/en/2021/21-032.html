<p>The Government of Yukon is working to implement high-quality early-learning opportunities to support improved long-term outcomes for children in all areas of their education and development.</p>

<p>Yukon families will have increased access to high quality, affordable childcare options for their children starting on April 1, 2021. Additionally, full-time early kindergarten programs will be offered in all rural Yukon schools starting in the 2021–22 school year.</p>

<p>To support these initiatives and coordinate early learning services, the Child Care Services Unit will transfer to the Department of Education as of April 1, 2021.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is currently engaging with Yukon First Nations governments and key stakeholders, including childcare operators and education partners, on how to create a universal childcare model for Yukon based on the principles of affordability, accessibility and quality, and enhanced early Kindergarten programming at all rural schools in Yukon.</p>

<p>These actions are in direct response to Putting People First, a roadmap to transform Yukon’s health and social services system into a more integrated, collaborative and person-centred system that will better meet the needs of Yukoners. The Government of Yukon continues to work with partners on the implementation of Putting People First to ensure Yukoners have a better and more sustainable system for years to come.</p>

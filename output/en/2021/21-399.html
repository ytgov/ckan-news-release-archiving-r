<p>Three Yukon residents<br>
	Three out of territory residents</p>

<h2>Public exposure notice</h2>

<ul>
<li>Air North Flight 4N569<br>
		Whitehorse to Vancouver<br>
		Tuesday, October 5, 2021<br>
		Scheduled departure 3:30 p.m., arrival 5:45 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone on this flight is asked to monitor until October 19 and arrange for testing if any symptoms appear.</p>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>The acting Chief Medical Officer of Health continues to remind everyone who has symptoms to get tested, no matter where they are located.

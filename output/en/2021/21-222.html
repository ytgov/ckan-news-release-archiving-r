<p>Premier Silver has issued the following statement: </p>

<p>“I would like to extend my deepest condolences to former Chief Paul Birckel’s beloved family, friends and everyone who had the honour of knowing him.</p>

<p>“Paul was elected as Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Chief in 1978 and went on to serve five terms. Through his role as Chief, he led many impactful initiatives, including the first land claims settlements in the Yukon.</p>

<p>“He was a thoughtful leader. He listened to Yukoners and worked diligently to resolve issues and strengthen his community. In 2000, Indspire Canada presented him with the Indspire Award which celebrates excellence within the Aboriginal community. And in 2002, he was awarded the Queen’s Golden Jubilee for his outstanding and exemplary contributions to his community.</p>

<p>“In 1995, he received the Businessman of the Year Award from the Yukon Chamber of Commerce to recognize his efforts. As an esteemed businessman, Paul supported the Yukon First Nations purchase of the Yukon Inn and launched a forest operation division at Dakwakada. </p>

<p>“Paul spent much of his time on the land near Dezadeash Lake with his wife Kathy. On behalf of Yukoners, our thoughts are with his family, his memory and positive impacts on the Yukon will live on forever.” </p>

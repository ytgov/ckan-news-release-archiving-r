<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of today, February 4, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 70. Sixty-nine people have recovered, one person has died, and there are no active cases. We have tested 6,315 people.</p>

<h3>Vaccination rollout progress</h3>

<p>As of end of day Wednesday, February 3, there were 9,931 doses of the Moderna vaccine administered in Yukon. Visit Yukon.ca for the latest vaccination data and progress reporting.</p>

<p>Mobile clinics administering vaccines to residents age 18 and older have completed trips to Pelly Crossing, Teslin, Carcross and Tagish. This week they are in Burwash Landing, Destruction Bay, Carmacks, Faro, Haines Junction, Mayo and Stewart Crossing.</p>

<p>A second vaccine dose is being administered to all staff and residents of long-term care homes beginning February 1.</p>

<p>Second vaccines for the communities will be available in the near future when the mobile clinics return. Residents will have the opportunity receive their first shot during the second visit. A third visit will ensure that everyone in the communities is able to get immunized. Second doses will be available to all those who receive the first dose prior to February 6.  The booking site for second doses will be available early next week for both rural and Whitehorse residents.</p>

<p>Plans to open a Whitehorse vaccination clinic for the general public February 10 are being delayed until further notice due to a lag in shipments of the vaccine. Yukon’s vaccine rollout schedule was designed to be flexible based on vaccine availability. The supply of vaccines remains the responsibility of the federal government and we continue to receive assurances that Yukon will receive its full allotment of doses before March 31, 2021.</p>

<p>To date, the information that we have received still means that all Yukon citizens who would like to be immunized will be able to receive the vaccine by the end of April 2021.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>From Wednesday, January 27, to Tuesday, February 2, there were 70 people tested at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre</a> is open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday. Those experiencing severe symptoms and requiring immediate assistance can go to the Whitehorse General Hospital Emergency Department, a community hospital or health centre.</p>

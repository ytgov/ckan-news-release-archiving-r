<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>State of emergency</h3>

<p>As of today, Yukon is extending the state of emergency under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em>. This extension is critical to supporting the health, safety and economic wellbeing of Yukoners and ensures that all Ministerial Orders enacted under the State of Emergency remain in place, including the requirement for those entering the territory to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p>A full list of the orders and legislative changes made under the Civil Emergency Measures Act can be found on <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/latest-updates-covid-19/legislation-changes-covid-19">https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/latest-updates-covid-19/legislation-changes-covid-19</a></p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of Tuesday, March 2, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 72. Seventy-one people have recovered, one person has died and there are no active cases. We have tested 6,667 people.</p>

<h3>Vaccination rollout progress</h3>

<p>As of end of day Monday, March 1, there were 17,168 doses of the Moderna vaccine administered in Yukon. This number includes 11,503 first doses and 5,665 second doses. Visit Yukon.ca for the latest vaccination data and progress reporting.</p>

<p>A clinic opened March 1 in Whitehorse for residents age 18 and older to receive vaccines by appointment.</p>

<p>Second vaccines for Yukon communities are underway. Residents age 18 and older will have the opportunity receive their first shot during the second visit. A third visit will ensure that everyone in the communities is able to get immunized.</p>

<p>To book an appointment and find more information, visit <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/this-is-our-shot">https://yukon.ca/en/this-is-our-shot</a>.</p>

<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) Dr. Brendan Hanley is directing Grade 12 students who attended the F.H. Collins prom event on Friday, June 11, to self-isolate until end of day on Friday, June 25, at 11:59 p.m. This direction is issued under his authority under Sections 11 and 17 of the <em>Communicable Disease regulation</em> under the <em>Public Health and Safety Act</em>.</p>

<p>One of nine new confirmed cases of COVID-19 for today is a student at the school who attended the event. Everyone who attended the F.H. Collins Cap and Gown event on Thursday, June 10, are being asked to self-monitor only. Letters are being sent to students involved.</p>

<p>In addition, under this same authority, Dr. Hanley is directing students in four Grade 9 classes at Porter Creek Senior Secondary to self-isolate until end of day on Friday, June 25. Letters are being sent to students in those classes.  If students or their parents do not receive a letter by end of day Friday, June 18th, the student is not required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>There are now 64 active cases in the territory including one probable case and three out of territory residents currently in Yukon. Thirty one are confirmed as the Gamma (P.1) variant, however it is presumed that all are this variant of concern.</p>

<p>Yukon’s total case count: 153 confirmed</p>

<p>For the new cases today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nine confirmed cases, including one out of territory case who has been diagnosed in Yukon.</li>
	<li>Today’s cases are in Whitehorse with one in a rural community.</li>
	<li>All are isolating and recovering at home.</li>

<p>We have identified both these two Whitehorse high schools because of the sheer number of people who are affected. We are seeing other school cases but are so far able to focus our contact tracing and advice to students and parents. Fortunately, we are not yet seeing evidence of transmission within the schools but rather young people acquiring COVID-19 in the community and then going to school. The fact that school is now over is also helping us. </p>

<p>Premier Sandy Silver has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“The territory has lost one of its longest serving leaders with the passing of former Deputy Premier of the Yukon and Mayor of Dawson City Peter Jenkins. I want to extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends and loved ones during their time of grief.</p>

<p>“Peter was first elected as Mayor of Dawson City in 1980, and continued as an elected official for three decades. He served in a variety of roles such as Environment Minister, Health Minister and Leader of the Yukon Party.</p>

<p>“Peter was always happy to share insights and knowledge with others, and I value the advice he offered me from when I first became the MLA for Klondike right through to serving as Premier.</p>

<p>“In addition to his political career, Peter was also a well-known and successful entrepreneur and hotel owner, remembered fondly by many Yukoners for his desire to give back to his local community.</p>

<p>“In memory of his lengthy public service, flags at the Government of Yukon Main Administration Building will be flown at half-mast for seven days. I encourage all Yukoners to reflect on Peter’s legacy as a passionate leader of the Yukon.”</p>

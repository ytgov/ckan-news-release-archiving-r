<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting 18 new cases of COVID-19 for today. This brings the active case count to 107 with reported recoveries. Since June 4, 2021, all of the variant testing results received to date are positive for the Gamma variant.</p>

<p>Yukon’s total case count: 242</p>

<p>For the new cases since noon on June 23:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eighteen confirmed cases</li>
	<li>Investigation and contact tracing is under way to verify where cases are in Yukon.</li>
	<li>Fifty three individuals in the most recent outbreak have recovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>COVID-19 is being widely transmitted throughout Yukon, primarily affecting unvaccinated people and is now present in most Yukon communities. Eleven of 14 communities are home to COVID-19 positive people.</p>

<h3>People with symptoms</h3>

<p>Testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever. People who are vaccinated may also rarely acquire COVID-19 and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online </a>for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or book on-line to arrange for testing at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/</a>. Drive-up testing is available in Whitehorse at the CTAC 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. daily at 49A Waterfront Place.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre.</p>

<p>We know that COVID-19 is hitting Yukoners of every age, from one year to 90 years. We are working as hard as we can to provide advice to individuals on how they need to respond to a possible or known exposure to COVID-19. I understand that people are concerned, especially parents of young ones when there is what appears to be a delay in notification. What is important to remember is that very young children do not get as ill as older folks. And, we need time to work through who are contacts and who are not. It is still just as important that people stay home if ill, get tested if they have symptoms and get vaccinated.</p>

<p><em>Please note the public exposure notice has been updated. At this time only people who are symptomatic and have been at the 98 Hotel between Saturday, June 19, 2021, and Sunday, June 27, 2021, should get tested.</em></p>

<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting 10 new cases of COVID-19 for today and one additional death. This brings the active case count to 130 with reported recoveries. Since June 4, 2021, all of the variant testing results received to date are positive for the Gamma (P.1) variant.</p>

<p>Yukon’s total case count since March 22, 2020: 342</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on June 28:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ten confirmed cases.</li>
	<li>Four cases in Whitehorse and 6 cases in rural communities.</li>
	<li>Two-hundred eight individuals in the most recent outbreak have recovered.</li>
	<li>Five deaths since November 2020.</li>
	<li>One case is a non Yukon resident, this case is included in the active case count, but not in the total case count.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Public exposure notice</strong></h2>

<p>Anyone who was at the 98 Hotel between Saturday, June 19, 2021, and Sunday, June 27, 2021, during opening hours should seek testing and stay home if you have any symptoms. If you do not have symptoms, self-monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days after your possible exposure.</p>

<h2><strong>Closure notice issued</strong></h2>

<p>The office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued a closure notice for Bambinos Bilingual Montessori Daycare from Monday, June 28, 2021 to Friday, July 9, 2021 as a result of transmission within the daycare. The office is issuing letters to all Yukon daycares reminding them of the need to practice infection control protocols, and to screen both staff and attendees for illness daily, ensuring that those who are ill are not working or attending the facility. Going forward, daycares where transmission has occurred will be publicly identified.</p>

<p>Employers, including self-employed individuals, are reminded they can access the <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/economic-and-social-supports-covid-19/paid-sick-leave">Paid Sick Leave Rebate</a> to support workers who do not have access to paid sick leave. Yukon.ca/paid-sick-leave-rebate. Keeping people who are ill out of the workplace is critical to limit transmission and will help protect everyone.</p>

<h2><strong>People with symptoms</strong></h2>

<p>Testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever. People who are vaccinated may also rarely acquire COVID-19 and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online </a>for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or book on-line to arrange for testing at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/.&amp;nbsp">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/.&amp;nbsp</a>; Drive-up testing is available in Whitehorse at the CTAC 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily at 49A Waterfront Place.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</strong></p>

<p>As of today, January 20, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 70. Sixty-nine people have recovered, one person has died and there are no active cases. We have tested 6,175 people.<br>
	 </p>

<p><strong>Vaccination rollout progress</strong></p>

<p>As of end of day Tuesday, 2,590 Yukoners have received their first dose of the Moderna vaccine, including all staff and residents of long-term care homes who chose to participate. Visit <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/latest-updates-covid-19/current-covid-19-situation">Yukon.ca </a>for the latest vaccination data and progress reporting.</p>

<p>There are currently 18 mobile clinics scheduled in rural and remote areas, and residents within designated communities who are age 18 and older can receive a vaccine.</p>

<p>Yukoners living in Whitehorse, Ibex Valley, Marsh Lake and Mount Lorne areas can also book a vaccine appointment if they are 70 years and older or live in group settings. Whitehorse and area residents age 60 and older will be eligible starting February 1 and everyone 18 and over can receive a shot starting February 10.</p>

<p>Appointments can be booked at <a href="https://yukon.ca/this-is-our-shot">yukon.ca/this-is-our-shot </a>or by calling 1-877-374-0425. After receiving a vaccine Yukoners must continue following health measures, such as wearing a mask.<br>
	 </p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 testing</strong></p>

<p>From Wednesday, January 13, to Tuesday, January 19, there were 56 people tested at the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre and drive-thru testing locations in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC)</a> is open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday. The drive-thru testing centre in Whitehorse will be closing at the end of the day Friday, January 22, as significantly fewer Yukoners have been using the service in recent weeks. Services at the CTAC will be enhanced as required.  </p>

<p>Those experiencing severe symptoms and requiring immediate assistance can go to the Whitehorse General Hospital Emergency Department, a community hospital or a health centre.<br>

<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of today, Wednesday, January 27, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 70. Sixty-nine people have recovered, one person has died and there are no active cases. We have tested 6,245 people.</p>

<h3>Vaccination rollout progress</h3>

<p>As of end of day Tuesday, January 26, there were 5,170 doses of the Moderna vaccine administered in Yukon. Visit <a href="https://yukon.ca/en">Yukon.ca </a>for the latest vaccination data and progress reporting.</p>

<p>There are currently 14 mobile clinics scheduled in rural and remote areas, and residents within designated communities who are age 18 and older can receive a vaccine. A mobile clinic will also be offering a second vaccine dose to all staff and residents of long-term care homes starting the week of February 1.</p>

<p>Yukoners living in Whitehorse, Ibex Valley, Marsh Lake and Mount Lorne areas aged 60 and older can now book appointments for the week starting February 1. Those 65 and older are already eligible to book an appointment and receive a vaccine, and everyone 18 and over can receive a shot starting February 10.</p>

<p>Appointments can be booked at <a href="https://yukon.ca/this-is-our-shot">yukon.ca/this-is-our-shot </a>or by calling 1-877-374-0425. Proof of residency will be required to receive a vaccination, such as government issued identification, a Yukon health care card, or mail displaying your name and address. After receiving a vaccine Yukoners must continue following health measures, such as wearing a mask.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has issued a State of Emergency under the <em>Civil Emergency Measures Act</em> in response to flooding in the Southern Lakes region, including Lake Laberge.</p>

<p>This State of Emergency gives the Government of Yukon the tools and flexibility to ensure the safety and security of residents impacted by flooding in the Southern Lakes region. It expands the toolbox the Yukon government can draw from to mitigate the impacts of the flood, including issuing evacuation orders, as needed. With the rapidly changing situation, this step is critical to ensuring our ability to respond effectively to help residents in need.</p>

<p>The State of Emergency will be in effect for up to 90 days and can be cancelled at any time.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has mounted the largest flood relief effort in Yukon’s history to deal with unprecedented water levels. The declaration of this state of emergency provides us the ability to provide effective and timely response to those individuals who need our assistance the most. We are aware that this is a stressful time for all Yukoners, and particularly for those residents directly impacted by the current flood situation. We want to reassure those residents we will do everything we can to continue providing all the support we can to you in the coming weeks.</p>

        <p>A robust Incident Management Team is in place in Southern Lakes with more than 60 Government of Yukon personnel, flood specialists from Manitoba and Saskatchewan and approximately 100 members of the Canadian Armed Forces actively engaged with the Incident.</p>

        <p>If an evacuation alert is issued, it signals to affected residents that they need to be ready to leave their homes on short notice. We will do everything we can to ensure an evacuation alert is issued ahead of an evacuation order to give residents some time to prepare to leave their homes.</p>

        <p>If an evacuation order is issued, it means affected residents are at risk and must leave the area immediately. The evacuation order may be issued without a preceding alert, if there isn’t enough warning.</p>

        <p>If the Government of Yukon needs to issue an evacuation alert or order, it will be distributed through door-to-door direct contact with affected residents and then released publicly through a variety of means.</p>

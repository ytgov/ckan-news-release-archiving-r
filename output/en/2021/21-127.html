<p>I have had the pleasure of working with all of the individuals appointed today and I am confident that they will continue their excellent work and their commitment to leadership in the Yukon government. These individuals will join the highly collaborative and dedicated leadership team currently in place and will continue to help deliver on our commitments to Yukoners.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Pamela Muir for her dedication to the public service. Pam has had an extensive career with the Yukon government and throughout her time, she has maintained the highest standards as a public servant and as a leader. We are sad that she is leaving the team and will miss her skills and expertise. I wish her all the best in her retirement.</p>

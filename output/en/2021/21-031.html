<p>The Government of Yukon has approved a regulatory framework for the practice of midwifery in the territory, marking the completion of a key step in the initiative to regulate, fund and integrate midwifery services into Yukon’s healthcare system.</p>

<p>The new <em>Midwifery </em><em>Regulation</em>, under the <em>Health Professions Act, </em>will work alongside standards of practice and a code of ethics to assure Yukoners that licensed midwives in the territory have met qualification standards and that there are rules in place to support the safe practice of midwifery in Yukon.</p>

<p>Under the Regulation, licensed midwives will be able to practice as they do elsewhere in Canada, supporting clients through pregnancy, birth and the post-partum period.</p>

<p>The <em>Midwifery Regulation</em>, standards of practice and code of ethics will take effect on April 15, 2021. The Department of Health and Social Services continues to work towards the launch of funded and regulated midwifery services in fall 2021.</p>

<p>I am proud to announce today that we have completed the Midwifery Regulation that will allow licensed midwives to safely support mothers through pregnancy, birth and the post-partum period. This is an important step towards realizing our government’s commitment to providing regulated and funded midwifery services as a birthing option for Yukoners.</p>

<p>We are very excited to have the regulatory framework finalized.  A lot of work and input from health care professionals and the community have led us to this point. We are very grateful for their expertise and look forward to working with them in partnership as we move forward to integrate midwifery care into the existing health care system in a way that is safe, sustainable and complements existing services. </p>

<p>After many years of hard work of advocacy, CMAY is very excited to see the regulations come through. We know that there is still much work to do and are looking forward to development of Standards of Practice, and especially the implementation of Midwifery and midwives actually working as part of Yukon Health Care aligned with the Canadian Model of Midwifery Care.</p>

    <ul class="">
<li class="field__item">
        <p>The development of the regulatory framework for midwifery in Yukon involved extensive engagement, consultation and research. This included: seeking the advice of a Midwifery Advisory Committee made of up of key healthcare partners; public engagement with Yukoners, midwives, physicians, and nurses; consultation with the Canadian Association of Midwives and regulators of midwifery in other Canadian jurisdictions; incorporation of best practices from other Canadian jurisdictions; and consideration of Yukon’s unique context.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>Yukon’s <em>Midwifery Regulation</em> establishes a regulatory framework similar to British Columbia (B.C.), allowing the adoption of many of B.C.’s standards of practice as initial Yukon standards, as well as other initial standards unique to Yukon. Over time, the Registrar of Midwives will work with the advisory committee established under the Regulation to review and adapt standards as necessary to reflect the evolution of midwifery practice in Yukon.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The Regulation identifies such items as licensing requirements; required professional liability insurance; the range of services midwives can legally provide; and the creation of an advisory committee.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The midwifery program is expected to take a phased approach to the implementation of regulated and funded midwifery services in Yukon by first focusing on establishment of full midwifery services in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley confirms that a possible case linked to multiple contacts over the past week has<strong> </strong>tested negative for COVID-19. This person was initially tested outside of the territory using a point-of-care rapid test, which gave a positive result. To confirm the results, the Government of Yukon requested a second test using the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that is considered to be the gold standard in COVID-19 testing.</p>

<p>Out of an abundance of caution, close contacts of the individual were instructed to self-isolate while we investigated the situation and awaited the result of the gold standard test. A negative result was confirmed on Thursday afternoon and Yukon Communicable Disease Centre contacted all individuals who were in self-isolation. Those who were in isolation solely due to their contact with this individual were able to resume regular activities. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of community transmission. At this time, Yukon has 10 active cases in two clusters among household or family contacts.</p>

<p>We took a very proactive approach after hearing this individual had received a positive result outside of the territory. We asked all identified contacts to self-isolate to avoid potential spread of the disease. We are relieved and very grateful for the cooperation of this person and their close contacts and are pleased that further confirmatory testing is negative. Our ability to identify contacts and to respond rapidly to possible cases is one of the reasons we have remained with low COVID-19 activity in the territory.  </p>

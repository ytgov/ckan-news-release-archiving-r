<p><em>Joint news release with the Yukon Advisory Committee on MMIWG2S+</em></p>

<p>The Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) is marking the release of the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan on the two-year anniversary of the release of the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People (MMIWG2S+): Reclaiming Power and Place.</p>

<p>The YAC on MMIWG2S+ looks forward to continuing to work with federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as Indigenous women’s organizations across the country to identify concrete ways to move this important work forward. The YAC recognizes and affirms the commitment to ensuring the National Action Plan is a living document that evolves to reflect community needs and priorities. The committee also recognizes the valuable expertise and experience of family members of MMIWG2S+, and acknowledges their incredible contributions, advocacy and bravery despite incredibly challenging circumstances.</p>

<p>On December 10, 2020, the YAC released Changing the Story to Upholding Dignity and Justice: Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ Strategy. This long-term strategy represents a whole-of-Yukon approach, outlining specific action plans and roles for all stakeholders and all Yukoners to play. The YAC has now created a technical working group to finalize the implementation plan, which will detail concrete actions to be taken by partners and stakeholders. The Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate, Jeanie McLean, will continue to act as co-chair of the YAC throughout this process.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Government of Yukon, I thank all the local and national representatives who worked together steadily to lead us towards a National Action Plan on MMIWG2S+. I look forward to taking action to implement Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ strategy and Canada’s National Action Plan, which together will contribute to healing, community safety, economic empowerment and community dialogue, not only here in the Yukon but also across Canada.</p>

<p>This action plan affects all Yukoners and all Canadians. We all have a responsibility to keep our daughters, mothers, grandmothers, sisters, partners and friends safe from harm. We have lost too many people already. And our lives, our families, and our communities have been forever changed by those losses. Shä̀w níthän to everyone who has worked hard to bring us to where we are today in this process. I look forward to taking the next steps alongside our local and national partners. </p>

<p>It is only by working together that we can take the action that is needed to end violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ individuals. It has been an honour to be part of the National Family and Survivors Circle, ensuring that the voice of Yukon families remains at the heart of the National Action Plan.</p>

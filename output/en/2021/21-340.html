<p>The Government of Yukon will host the annual United Way Breakfast fundraiser on Friday, September 24, at Mount McIntyre Recreation Centre from 7 to 10:30 a.m. To respect everyone's level of comfort with the current COVID-19 situation and to ensure appropriate public health measures, this year's event will be a drive-through take-away breakfast.</p>

<p>This year's theme "We are better together" encourages Yukoners to continue to show their support for local businesses and work together to protect one another. All funds raised from ticket sales, cash donations and the online auction will stay in the Yukon and go to support local charities and community organizations. The United Way Yukon has partnered with the Wandering Bison and Northern Vision Development to create a breakfast package for participants. Yukoners will enjoy a hot breakfast burrito made with local, high-quality ingredients.</p>

<p>Tickets cost $15 for adults, $10 for seniors and $5 for kids 12 years old and younger. Yukoners can purchase their tickets in advance at unitedwayyukon.ca. Yukoners are encouraged to order in groups to decrease the number of car trips needed and can submit their orders ahead. To reduce food wastage, all unsold breakfasts will be delivered to the Whitehorse Food Bank after the event.</p>

<p>Each year, a silent auction is held to help raise money at the breakfast. This year's auction will take place online and Yukoners will be able to bid on item over several days starting on the morning of the breakfast. Details are on <a href="https://www.unitedwayyukon.ca/">the United Way Yukon website.</a></p>

<p>The United Way does transformative work in communities across the country, including here in the Yukon. I would like to encourage everyone to come out and enjoy the United Way Breakfast on September 24 and help support local charities and community groups across the Yukon. Many thanks to United Way for all the work they do in our communities and to the Wandering Bison and Northern Vision Development for partnering with us this year. This year’s event may look a little different, but shows that we can still find innovative ways to support one another and prove we are better together.</p>

<p>Premier Sandy Silver has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“I mourn with Yukoners after the remains of 215 children were discovered on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School on May 27<sup>th</sup>. This devastating discovery reinforces Canada’s historic and ongoing struggle with systemic racism. </p>

<p>My heart goes out to those Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation families who now wait to confirm the identities of the 215 children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School – and with those in the Yukon and across Canada who bear the burden of the residential school experience. While these discoveries are painful, I hope they bring truth to these families and communities. Out of respect, flags on all Yukon government buildings will be flown at half-mast for 215 hours to honour those who suffered trauma and harm along with their families and communities who are mourning.</p>

<p>I know many Yukoners are grieving right now and reliving the painful trauma they have experienced. Mental health services are available to Yukoners both in Whitehorse and in rural Yukon communities through Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services. Yukoners can schedule Rapid Access Counselling supports in Whitehorse and all MWSU community hubs by calling 1-867-456-3838.</p>

<p>The pain caused by residential schools is an ever present part of our society. We need to acknowledge this shameful aspect of our national identity and strengthen our resolve to advance reconciliation. As Justice Murray Sinclair said in a visit to the Yukon, 'there is no reconciliation without truth.' These atrocities are shocking but we cannot hide from them. We stand in support for the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation and all Indigenous communities as they continue to search for and uncover evidence of the harms committed against them by governments and churches throughout Canada.</p>

<p>All Canadians need to work together to address our complicated history and create a brighter future for the next generation. Our government remains committed to working with our First Nations partners to advance reconciliation.”</p>

<p>Premier Silver has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“Today marks the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic.</p>

<p>Around the country today, flags are being flown at half-mast to honour all those around the world who have lost their lives from COVID-19.</p>

<p>No one is immune from the impacts of COVID-19, and they continue to affect all of us. Simple things we once took for granted like hugging a loved one, celebrating accomplishments and coming together to grieve a loss have had to be postponed. Yukoners have had to make tremendous personal sacrifices to keep each other safe. It is thanks to your vigilance and care for one another that we have limited the spread of the virus here in the territory.</p>

<p>The last 12 months have seen unprecedented collaboration and cooperation across the country. Leaders have recognized the unique circumstances and vulnerabilities of the territories and provided support for northerners throughout the pandemic response, from personal protective equipment to vaccine allocations and economic aid. I am especially proud of the coordination across all levels of government as we navigate the largest immunization campaign in Canada’s history. Yukon is in a fortunate position to be able to provide vaccines to every eligible adult that wants one. Every day more Yukoners are stepping up and taking their shot to keep our territory healthy and safe. Our goal is to vaccinate as many Yukoners as possible so we can lift COVID-19 restrictions and continue on our path forward.</p>

<p>On behalf of all Yukoners, I would like to offer deep gratitude to all our healthcare professionals and essential front-line workers. Throughout a time of great uncertainty, the tireless efforts of these heroes have ensured that we have reliable access to services, dependable supply chains, and support for our loved ones.</p>

<p>As we look toward brighter days ahead, continue practising the Safe 6, mask up and be sure to get immunized. Also continue to check in on your friends and family, support your communities, and take care of one another."</p>

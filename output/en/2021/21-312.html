<p>The Government of Yukon is sharing the feedback collected from students, families and school staff about their perspectives and experiences on learning, health and safety and mental health during the last half of the 2020–21 school year.</p>

<p>Thank you to all of the students, families and school staff who took the time to share their experiences and perspectives at the end of the 2020–21 school year. It is through your hard work and dedication to keep one another safe that we can return to a near-normal 2021–22 school year.

<p>The Government of Yukon has launched the third instalment of the learning during COVID-19 survey to gather feedback from students, families and school staff on their experiences and perspectives related to learning as well as health and safety during the last half of the school year.</p>

<p>The survey includes new questions on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and wellness; the types of mental health and wellness services being accessed; and awareness of support services and the preferences for accessing them. Questions were also expanded to explore whether respondents felt there was lost learning this year.</p>

<p>A link to the online survey was sent directly to families and school staff by email on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. The survey will remain open until the end of the day on Wednesday, June 23, 2021.</p>

<p>This third survey will help us ensure students are successful and supported in their learning in the upcoming school year – while also protecting their health and safety. We want to know how the pandemic has impacted students’ mental health and well-being and we intend to use the survey feedback to ensure supports are meeting their needs. I encourage Yukon students, school staff and families to participate in this online survey and share how they are doing as they head into a well-deserved summer break.</p>

<p><em>Please note the outdoor informal social gathering limits for vaccinated people have been amended. </em></p>

<p>Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting six new confirmed cases of COVID-19 between 12 p.m. Tuesday, July 13, and 12 p.m. today. With recoveries, this brings the active case count to 81. </p>

<p>Yukon’s total case count since March 22, 2020: 490; 420 cases since June 1, including out of territory residents diagnosed in Yukon and probable cases.</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on July 13, there are six confirmed cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Five cases in Whitehorse</li>
	<li>One case in a rural community</li>
</ul>
<p>Since June 1, 2021, three hundred and thirty-five individuals have recovered and there have been four deaths. There have been a total of six deaths since November 2020.</p>

<h2>Changes to recommendations</h2>

<p>With the daycare outbreak now under control and most cases recovered, the CMOH is advising that as of Monday, July 19, daycares and day homes can welcome back all children and not just those of essential and critical workers. Child care workers are still required to wear a mask.</p>

<p>In addition, based on risk and where risk has been identified, sizes for organized gatherings may return to the May 25, 2021, levels of 200 indoors and 200 outdoors provided physical distancing is maintained and masks are worn indoors. Sizes for informal social gatherings may return to limits of 20 indoors and 50 outdoors if everyone is vaccinated. At events where individuals are unvaccinated, the CMOH is still recommending that participants "stick to six".</p>

<h2>People with symptoms</h2>

<p>The CMOH is advising individuals to assume that COVID-19 is widespread, and act accordingly. Anyone experiencing any of the symptoms listed below, even mild, should get tested.</p>

<p>Testing for COVID-19 infection is more important than ever. People who are vaccinated may also rarely acquire COVID-19 and should seek testing if symptoms develop.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online </a>for faster access to results.</p>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online</a> to arrange for testing. Drive-up testing is available in Whitehorse at the CTAC 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily at 49A Waterfront Place.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their<a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/care-services/find-hospital-or-health-centre"> </a>rural <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/care-services/find-hospital-or-health-centre">community health centre</a> to arrange for testing.</p>

<h2>Safe 6 plus 1</h2>

<p>The CMOH has made <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/advice-chief-medical-officer-health-july-14-2021">several strong temporary recommendations</a> to decrease gathering sizes and limit contacts. Everyone in the Yukon should continue to follow the Safe 6 plus 1 (plus one means wear a mask). See more information at: practisesafe6.ca.</p>

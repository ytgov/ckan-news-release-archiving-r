<p>Premier Silver has issued the following statement on the retirement of the Yukon’s Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell:</p>

<p>“On behalf of the Government of Yukon and all Yukoners, I want to thank our Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell for his many years of service.</p>

<p>“Larry has always been a fierce advocate for the Yukon. His dedication and work ethic are second to none. Larry has worked tirelessly throughout his career to advance countless projects in the territory that have benefitted all Yukoners, from immigration, transportation, and community infrastructure to housing, education and early learning and child care.</p>

<p>“Larry’s work representing the Yukon has been recognized across party lines throughout his career. His many accolades, including Parliamentarian of the Year, hardest working Member of Parliament and best constituency Member of Parliament are all well deserved.</p>

<p>“Before being elected to represent the Yukon on Parliament Hill, Larry was recognized for his outstanding volunteer efforts.</p>

<p>“He is well-known and respected throughout the Yukon for his community service and engagement, including his work with the Skookum Jim Friendship Centre, the Yukon Learn Society and the United Way.</p>

<p>“So thank you, Larry, for all of your hard work to support our territory and make life better for Yukoners.”</p>

<p>Premier Silver has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“I am saddened to learn of the passing of Archie Lang. Archie was very committed to the territory and had an impressive political career. He was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the general election on November 4, 2002 and continued to represent Porter Creek Centre as an MLA in the Yukon Party until 2011.</p>

<p>During Archie’s time with the Government of Yukon he served as the Minister of Highways and Public Works, Community Services, and Energy, Mines and Resources. Archie was greatly involved in Yukon’s outfitting and tourism sector, and he served on a number of Boards to advance business activity and share his insight.</p>

<p>To commemorate Archie Lang’s service to Yukon, flags at the Government of Yukon Main Administration Building will fly at half-mast for seven days.</p>

<p>My thoughts go out to his wife, Karen and his three children Graham, Meagan and Fraser, as well as his considerable extended family. Archie’s integral role in government over the years will always be remembered. Yukon has lost one of its great champions. May his memory live on through his stories."</p>

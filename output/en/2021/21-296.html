<p>The Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott is reporting 13 new cases of COVID-19 from 12 p.m. Friday, August 13, to 12 p.m. today. The number of active cases is currently at 40.  </p>

<p>Total number of confirmed Yukon cases since March 22, 2020: 660; 600 cases since June 1, including out of territory residents diagnosed in the Yukon and probable cases. Out of territory individuals who are diagnosed in the Yukon are counted in the active count but not in the Yukon total case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction.</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on August 13, there are 13 new cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>7  cases in Whitehorse and 6 in rural Yukon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since June 1, 2021, 614 people have recovered and six people have died, five of whom were unvaccinated and one was partially vaccinated. A total of eight people have died from COVID-19 since November 2020.</p>

<p>The Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health continues to monitor daily activity and as active cases decrease and daily case counts are stabilized, information bulletins may no longer be issued daily. The number of cases will continue to be updated Monday through Friday online.</p>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online</a> to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre. Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be accessed <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">online </a>for faster access to results.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is working to establish a new public health agency for the Yukon as part of the ongoing implementation of the Putting People First recommendations. Premier Sandy Silver has appointed Michael Hale as an additional Deputy Minister with the Department of Health and Social Services to oversee the development of the new public health agency.</p>

<p>Deputy Minister Stephen Samis will focus on the delivery of social services and oversee the ongoing public health response to COVID-19 in the Yukon in coordination with the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Mr. Hale will focus on the delivery of healthcare services and the integration of the territory’s medical services into a new public health agency.</p>

<p>The Putting People First report lays out how to transform Yukon’s health and social services system into a more integrated, collaborative and person-centred system that will better meet the needs of Yukoners. The reports 76 recommendations to improve service delivery in the Yukon were endorsed by the Yukon government in August, 2020.</p>

<p>One of the main recommendations is to create a new, arms-length government agency that delivers a people-centred healthcare system in the territory and contracts with NGOs or other providers to deliver specialty services on their behalf. This includes responsibility for the hospitals currently under the Yukon Hospital Corporation and primary care, long-term care and treatment facilities under the Department of Health and Social Services.</p>

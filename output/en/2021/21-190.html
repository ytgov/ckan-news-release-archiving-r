<p>The COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre (CTAC) will open a drive-up testing centre tonight to assist with demand for testing since the beginning of the most recent outbreak.</p>

<p>While CTAC has been able to meet most of the demand for testing with indoor testing, the drive up option will assist those who are nervous about their exposure by coming inside. They can now request an in-car option.</p>

<p>The drive-up centre will be open from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. seven days a week to provide surge capacity during the outbreak. The centre will be staffed by health professionals from both Health and Social Services and from Emergency Medical Services.</p>

<p>CTAC has tested 577 people since June 9 with appointments heavily booked most days. The opening of the drive-up option adds 33 testing slot per day. Appointments are required and can be booked online at <a href="https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/">https://book-covid-19-test.service.yukon.ca/en/</a>. The drive-up testing unit will be located in the parking lot adjacent to CTAC.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is also extending youth vaccination clinics. The clinics will continue to offer 1st doses for youth on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>In communities, youth can receive their 1st dose at the next community clinic. In Whitehorse, youth can book an appointment online or walk in to the clinic at the Convention Centre. Appointments can be booked online at Yukon.ca/this-is-our-shot.    </p>

<p>We continue to encourage people who have any COVID-19 symptoms to get tested. This outbreak has impacted hundreds of individuals and will likely impact hundreds more. This additional testing option will help meet demand and provide additional options for those seeking a test. In addition to testing, it is vital that all Yukoners, including our youth, get fully vaccinated to protect our communities. It is now more important than ever to step up and take your shot.</p>

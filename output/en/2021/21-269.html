<p>The Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley is reporting one additional death from COVID-19 and seven new cases of COVID-19 from 12 p.m. Friday, July 30 to 12 p.m. today. The number of active cases is currently at 60. </p>

<p>Total number of confirmed Yukon cases since March 22, 2020: 603; 541 cases since June 1, including out of territory residents diagnosed in the Yukon and probable cases. Out of territory individuals who are diagnosed in the Yukon are counted in the active count but not in the Yukon total case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction.</p>

<p>For the new cases since 12 p.m. on July 30, there are seven new cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Six cases in Whitehorse, one in rural Yukon.</li>
	<li>The person who passed away was in their 40s and was not vaccinated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since June 1, 2021, 469 people have recovered and there have been six deaths. There have been a total of eight deaths since November 2020.</p>

<p>My sincerest sympathies are with the family of this individual who has passed. Until we see our vaccination rates increase further, we will continue to lose Yukoners to this disease. In this individual’s case, they were unvaccinated and had pre-existing conditions that contributed to their passing. This is another tragic example of how vaccination might have prevented a fatal outcome.</p>

<h2>Testing and vaccines</h2>

<p>Immunizers began returning to rural Yukon communities beginning this week, through to the third week of August. <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/appointments">Book an appointment online here. </a>They will be providing both first and second dose Pfizer for youth born in 2009 and up to the age of 17 and first and second doses of Moderna for those 18 and over. While appointments are recommended, walk-ins will be welcome.</p>

<p>Immunizers ask that if you have made an appointment and can’t attend to please let the health centre know so that vaccine is not wasted.</p>

<p>Testing continues to be a priority to enable health care responders to manage risk and outbreaks. Anyone experiencing symptoms in Whitehorse should call the COVID-19 Testing and Assessment Centre at 867-393-3083 or <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/find-respiratory-assessment-centre">book online</a> to arrange for testing.</p>

<p>People in communities should contact their rural community health centre. Testing turnaround times remain very quick, 24 hours in the previous week, and negative results can now be <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/your-health-covid-19/find-out-what-your-covid-19-test">accessed online</a> for faster access to results.</p>

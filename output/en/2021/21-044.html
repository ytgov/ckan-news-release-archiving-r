<p>The safety and well-being of Northerners are top priorities of the governments of Canada and Yukon. Today, Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, and Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker, announced funding for a new consolidated fire hall and public works building for the Town of Faro.</p>

<p>Both governments are taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, as they adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic and support the creation of jobs. Yukoners need municipal infrastructure facilities that are modern, efficient and environmentally responsible.</p>

<p>The new Faro Public Works and Fire hall will replace two existing buildings. The design of the new building meets the needs of the town, it includes seven vehicle bays, staff offices, shared meeting rooms, parts and tool storage, a morgue and decontamination areas.</p>

<p>The new building is designed to exceed minimum energy standards by 25 per cent. The mechanical design utilizes in-floor radiant heating, and air curtains on several of the overhead doors, in order to minimize heat loss. Additionally, the structural and electrical service components are designed to accommodate the potential installation of a roof-mounted photovoltaic array.</p>

<p>The Government is Yukon is providing $2,955,448 in addition to the Government of Canada’s investment of $8,866,344 for this project through the Small Communities Fund of the Investing in Canada Plan.</p>

<p>We are excited to be working with the Government of Canada to provide funding for this essential building for the Town of Faro. The community will benefit from this facility’s innovative and environmentally conscious design. It will house office-type spaces on the ground floor, and the second floor is a mezzanine for service spaces only. This includes seven vehicle bays; staff offices; shared meeting rooms; parts and tool storage; a morgue; and decontamination areas. We have worked collaboratively with the community to ensure this building meets their needs.</p>

<p>Residents of the Town of Faro will benefit from this state-of-the art building that will house vital fire response equipment and personnel, as well as essential public works staff and equipment needed in the community. This project to consolidate the fire hall and public works building is an efficient use of resources and goes to show just how municipal, territorial and federal governments can partner to bring these projects to reality, to the benefit of the community.</p>

<p>Today is a very exciting day for the Town of Faro! Improving and/or replacing aging municipal infrastructure continues to be a top priority for us as a Council and community. This new infrastructure will help to significantly improve safety and service quality to our community by our Volunteer Fire Service, Public Works, and the EMS departments. This project will also allow us to better support our neighbours and regional partners as well. Surely, this important project would not be possible without the full support and commitment of our Territorial and Federal funding partners, which we deeply value and appreciate.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is extending critical COVID-19 support programs available to Yukon’s tourism sector. The Tourism Accommodation Sector Supplement (TASS) and Tourism Non-Accommodation Sector Supplement (TNASS) programs have been extended until March 31, 2022.</p>

<p>The government is also extending the popular Great Yukon Summer Travel Rebate program until March 31, 2022. Eligible summer experience packages are extended until the end of October and new winter experience packages will be available on November 1, 2021, as part of the Great Yukon Summer Freeze.</p>

<h2>Relief programs changes</h2>

<p>The Tourism Accommodation and Non-Accommodation sector supplements were created to ensure the accommodations sector and other visitor-dependent businesses could access additional funding after they had exhausted other financial supports. The Tourism Accommodation Sector Supplement (TASS) provides up to $400 per room each month, up to the point of break even for eligible accommodations businesses. As of September 21, 2021, there are 24 Yukon businesses with TASS agreements for a total value of $1.5 million.</p>

<p>The Tourism Non-Accommodation Sector Supplement (TNASS) provides Yukon tourism operators and food and beverage businesses that rely on visitors for at least 60 per cent of their revenues up to $60,000 to cover eligible expenses up to the point of break even. As of September 21, 2021, there are 69 Yukon businesses with TNASS agreements for a total value of $2.9 million.</p>

<p>TASS and TNASS will now be administered by the Department of Economic Development. Many businesses currently enrolled in the Yukon Business Relief Program may still be eligible for support through TNASS and should contact <a href="mailto:ecdev@yukon.ca">ecdev@yukon.ca</a> for more information. Funding is available for both fixed and variable expenses. The only change will be that mortgage principle payments are no longer considered an eligible expense.</p>

<p>The Yukon Business Relief Program and the COVID-19 liquor licensee discount will end on September 30, 2021, as previously scheduled. The Yukon Business Relief Program was created to help businesses cover specific fixed costs while experiencing reduced revenue during the pandemic. As of August 19, 2021, over $10.5 million in payments have been provided to 543 Yukon businesses through the program.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 liquor licensee discount will be replaced by an updated pricing structure to support restaurants and other businesses with liquor licences as they continue to recover from the pandemic. As this sector is still recovering, on October 1, the discount will be replaced by an updated pricing structure supporting business investment and profitability.</p>

<h2>Great Yukon Summer Yukoner Travel Rebate Program</h2>

<p>The Great Yukon Summer Yukoner Travel Rebate program is aimed at encouraging Yukoners to vacation here in the territory. The Great Yukon Summer Freeze is a continuation of the summer program and will function the same, with Yukoners paying the full price up front and then applying for the 25 per cent rebate for eligible tourism packages offered by local operators. Winter packages will also start at $250 per person for experiences to take place between November 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022. The rebate program will continue to be administered by the Yukon Chamber of Commerce on behalf of government.</p>

<p>As the Yukon’s economy recovers from the pandemic, it is important that our government adjust our support programs to meet the evolving needs of the business community. Ending the Yukon Business Relief Program while extending support for visitor-dependent businesses will allow those still affected by reduced travel to get the help they need through the winter and encourage economic growth and self-reliance among non-tourism businesses.</p>

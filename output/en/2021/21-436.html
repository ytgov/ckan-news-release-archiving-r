<p>The newly established Economic Development Fund is providing more than $1 million to support 28 community projects throughout the Yukon. The new fund is supporting Yukon businesses and organizations with innovation, sustainability, planning, market support, and capital and capacity development.</p>

<p>A wide variety of economic sectors will benefit from support including local food production; renewable energy; transportation; tourism; arts; media development; wellness; and innovation. Recipients include The Yukon Soaps Company, North End Gallery and Discovelo Inc.</p>

<p>Project applications were evaluated according to their potential climate impacts and alignment with the Yukon’s goals for climate change adaptation and mitigation as identified in Our Clean Future: a Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy.</p>

<p>The Economic Development Fund was recently created to provide greater access to funding for critical projects that provide economic benefits to Yukoners. I am glad to see the program being used by a variety of local organizations and I hope that this is only the beginning. Our government will continue to work to support economic growth and diversification in the territory while reducing red tape and streamlining our application processes. </p>

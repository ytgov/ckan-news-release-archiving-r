<p>The Government of Yukon has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 cases and recoveries</h3>

<p>As of today, January 7, the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 69. Fifty-nine people have recovered, one person has died, and there are 9 active cases. We have tested 6,057 people.</p>

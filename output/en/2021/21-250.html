<p>Five municipalities are investing nearly $3.5 million of their portions of the Canada Community-Building Fund to upgrade existing recreational facilities in the Yukon.  </p>

<p>The 14 projects in five communities will improve seasonal and year-round facilities around the territory. The Village of Carmacks is redeveloping their Merv Tew Park to provide new attractions for residents and visitors, including installing a new gazebo, disc golf course and relocating the playground. In Haines Junction, accessibility upgrades will improve access to the Pine Lake trail system. The City of Dawson is building and upgrading its network of trails. In Whitehorse, an accessible playground is being built at the Canada Games Centre and on Schwatka Lake, floatplane docks and new parking lots will provide improved access to regional airport and recreational infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Village of Haines Junction used funding to replace the roof of the St. Elias Convention Centre to extend the life of this popular cultural events venue.</p>

<p>As of June 29, 2021, what was once known as the Gas Tax Fund, has been renamed the Canada Community-Building Fund. This name change better reflects the program’s evolution over time and will not alter or modify the objectives or requirements of the program. </p>

<p>Through the Canada Community-Building Fund, we are building welcoming, healthy and connected communities across the Yukon. Having access to modern, quality recreational and sports facilities is a strong incentive for encouraging regular physical activity.

<p>The Village of Carmacks was thrilled to hear that our three proposals to the Canada Community-Building Fund were all accepted. Merv Tew Park will see a major facelift with a new Disc Golf course, a new Gazebo and a Bandstand to host Village get-togethers once COVID passes. Parking will be improved to ensure the safety of our children and all the changes are designed to improve recreational enjoyment for our citizens. Our exciting new Official Community Plan is now complete and Council is very proud with the outcome. This funding helped us immensely by hiring wonderful, creative consultants to guide our decisions. The myriad of trails in the Carmacks area will be getting some much needed grooming and upgrading to improve the hikeability and likability, not only for our residents, but also for the many tourists that grace us every season. Thanks to the Canada Community-Building Fund, all of this was made possible.</p>

<p>The Canada Community-Building Fund helps the Village of Haines Junction to maintain, improve, and acquire additional recreational amenities.  These amenities are very important as they heighten the desirability of our Community as a place to live and work.   Additionally, it is very important to have this predictable funding, as it allows the Village to plan projects in a scheduled manner.</p>

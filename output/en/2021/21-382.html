<p>Education Minister Jeanie McLean has hired lawyer Amanda Rogers to conduct an independent review of the Government of Yukon’s response to an incident in 2019 at the Hidden Valley Elementary School.</p>

<p>The independent review will look into the Government of Yukon’s internal and inter-departmental processes in 2019 when allegations of child abuse by an educational assistant were brought forward to Department of Education staff. It will also include a broad and comprehensive review of established government policies and procedures around operations, reporting and communications to address serious incidents in Yukon schools. This will include reviewing how the Departments of Education, Health and Social Services and Justice work together to respond to serious incidents in schools and interact with the RCMP. Parents, families and guardians of students at Hidden Valley Elementary School will be involved in the review, along with partner organizations and agencies, including the RCMP.</p>

<p>A detailed report will be submitted to the Minister of Education in 2022 including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the facts around the Government of Yukon’s response to the incident in 2019 at the Hidden Valley Elementary School; and</li>
	<li>recommendations for improving government-wide policies and procedures to better support Yukon school communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amanda Rogers is an arbitrator, mediator and lawyer specializing in workplace conflict resolution. She has extensive experience practicing labour and employment law, working as a lawyer in both Ontario and British Columbia. She has a law degree from the University of Toronto and a Master's of Law specializing in Dispute Resolution from Osgoode Hall, York University.</p>

<p>Following a criminal incident in 2019, we recognize that there has been a breakdown in trust between families, Hidden Valley Elementary School and the Government of Yukon. I have heard directly from affected families about the pain and anger this situation has caused in our school community. I made a commitment to parents to involve them in a public review of government policies and protocols to ensure Yukon students are safe. This independent review will shed light on the Yukon government’s response in 2019 and provide recommendations for strengthening policies and procedures to better support our families and school communities going forward.</p>

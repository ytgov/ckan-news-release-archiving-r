<p>The Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott reports 44 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, from noon Wednesday, November 3, until noon Friday, November 5. The number of active cases is currently 102. With the increasing number of infected people, many of whom have no known connection to other known cases or exposures sites, the acting Chief Medical Officer of Health has confirmed there is now widespread community transmission of COVID-19 in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>The total number of confirmed cases in Yukon residents since March 2020 is 1017.</p>

<p>Since March 2020, 907 people have recovered. Ten people have died. </p>

<p>For the new cases since noon on Friday, November 5: </p>

<ul>
<li>Thirty-four are residents of Whitehorse.</li>
	<li>Five are residents of Carmacks.</li>
	<li>Five are residents of Watson Lake.</li>
</ul>
<p>People from out of the territory who are diagnosed in the Yukon are counted in the Yukon’s active case count but not in the Yukon’s total case count as they are counted in their home jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Given the increasing case numbers, the acting Chief Medical Officer of Health strongly encourages Yukoners to follow public health recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow the Safe 6.</li>
	<li>Wear a mask indoors.</li>
	<li>Limit indoor social gatherings to 20 people if everyone 12 and over is fully vaccinated.</li>
	<li>Limit social gatherings to 6 people if not everyone is fully vaccinated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Public exposure notice</h2>

<p>The Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Catherine Elliott has issued the following COVID-19 public exposure notice:</p>

<p>With widespread community transmission of COVID-19 in Whitehorse I am urging all Yukoners to wear a mask indoors and those who are not vaccinated to stick to six for their gatherings.  This is the time to use the protections we know well, and it has never been a better time to get vaccinated.</p>

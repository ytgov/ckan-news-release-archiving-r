<p>Premier Silver and Minister Frost have issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“We have received confirmation the Yukon will receive 16,100 doses of the Moderna vaccine by the end of the month. The mass clinic for all eligible Yukoners will open in Whitehorse as soon as possible following the arrival of these doses.</p>

<p>Opening the clinic to all Yukoners 18 and older reduces barriers for vaccine access, which aligns with recommendations that the greatest way to protect the community is to immunize as many individuals as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>We have consistently pushed the federal government to recognize the importance of immunizing northern, remote and Indigenous communities.</p>

<p>We appreciate how patient Yukoners have been and today’s confirmation is welcome news<em>. </em>Our planning teams are already at work to redesign clinic dates and delivery schedules so we can open up the Whitehorse clinic to all residents.</p>

<p>We have hit some very notable milestones. All eligible people at the long-term care homes have now received their full immunizations. Homebound people in Whitehorse have also received their second dose and are now fully vaccinated. The mobile teams have visited all rural communities and are making their way back to offer second doses to everyone eligible and first doses to those who may have missed the opportunity. We would like to thank the incredible team of people who have been working hard to get eligible Yukoners immunized against COVID-19.</p>

<p>Today’s commitment is very good news for Yukon. We are happy to know more doses are coming and the mass clinic will be open for all eligible Yukoners. We will share more information about when Yukoners can book appointments shortly.”</p>

<p>Families, individuals, and vulnerable Canadians in need of an affordable home can count on long-term funding for community housing in Yukon thanks to an agreement signed today by the federal and territorial governments.</p>

<p>The Honourable Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon, on behalf of the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Canada’s Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and the Honourable Pauline Frost, Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation, announced today they have reached a bilateral agreement under the National Housing Strategy. This cost-shared agreement demonstrates a joint commitment to prioritize affordable housing.</p>

<p>The 10-year agreement will invest nearly $60 million to protect, renew and expand social and community housing and support Yukon’s priorities related to housing repair, construction, and affordability. The governments of Canada and Yukon will also work together to design and implement a new Canada Housing Benefit for the territory to provide affordability support to families and individuals in need of housing.</p>

<p>This ‎progressive housing agreement commits the governments of Canada and Yukon to high standards of transparency, public engagement, and housing quality, including improved energy efficiency and accessibility. The agreement also acknowledges the importance of prioritizing people most in need, incorporating a human rights-based approach to housing, and applying a gender lens to all investments.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Long-term, predictable funding for housing has been needed for more than a decade. Today, with the Yukon government, we have taken a significant step toward our goal of building strong communities where Canadian families can prosper and thrive, now and for the future. Our Government will continue working in partnership with Yukon and other provinces and territories towards a 15 per cent expansion in new affordable housing units and renewing 20 per cent of existing community housing units across the country.</p>

<p><em>Joint news release with the Government of Canada</em></p>

<p>The renewal of public roads and local water and wastewater systems is key to improving Yukoners’ quality of life by creating jobs, protecting waterways and positioning communities for growth.</p>

<p>Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon, on behalf of the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable John Streicker, Yukon Minister of Community Services; and Deputy Mayor Lisa Snyder, Town of Faro, announced funding for water, sewer and road upgrades in the Town of Faro, Yukon.</p>

<p>The first component of this project will see upgrades to water mains and water service lines as well as the renewal of sanitary sewer mains. These improvements will provide residents with access to safer drinking water, improved water flows for firefighting, and increase the town’s capacity to manage sewage.</p>

<p>The project also calls for the replacement of more than three kilometres of public roads and utility access roads.</p>

<p>Through green infrastructure projects like this, northern communities are finding ways to protect the environment, optimize community resources, and improve the lives of citizens.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada is investing over $8.2 million in the project through the Green Infrastructure Stream (GIS) of the <em>Investing in Canada </em>infrastructure plan. The Yukon Government will contribute over $2.7 million to this project.<br>

<p>Faro provides great drinking water and the upgrades to the water lines will help us to maintain that. Our water and sewer lines are aging, so having all these upgrades will help us to remain sustainable in the future and allow us to continue providing excellent water and sewer services to our residents. Without the help of the federal and Yukon government, the Town could not manage these upgrades and we thank them for providing funding sources for our infrastructure needs.</p>

        <p>On June 27, 2019, the Government of Canada launched two new strategies: Canada’s Connectivity Strategy, which commits to connect all Canadians to high-speed internet, and Canada’s first Rural Economic Development Strategy, which will spur economic growth and create good, middle class jobs for rural Canadians across the country.</p>

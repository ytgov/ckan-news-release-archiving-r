<p>The Government of Yukon is ensuring Yukon schools meet current and future needs of the territory’s education system with over $30 million in capital funding for school projects in 2019–20. This includes $1.6 million to support planning for the first new elementary school in Whitehorse in 27 years. This new school will be located in Whistle Bend and is projected to open in 2023–24.</p>

<p>The new school will provide additional capacity and flexibility in Whitehorse, where student enrolment continues to grow. It will also be a key step in a long-term plan to renovate or replace priority schools that are aging and need seismic work, including Takhini Elementary and Whitehorse Elementary. Planning for the new school will include working with affected school communities to review Whitehorse attendance areas and student placements to ensure the effective use of all available learning spaces.</p>

<p>Additional projects planned for the coming year include continuing to work on the new French First Language Secondary School, remediation work at Ross River School, planning for the relocation of Kluane Lake School to Burwash Landing, a new portable for Golden Horn Elementary and upgrades to Robert Service School’s portables. There will also be work across all Yukon schools including modernizing technology, replacing playground equipment and continuing to work with all school communities on regular maintenance through the capital repair and maintenance process.</p>

<p>These projects are part of modernizing learning in Yukon and will ensure that Yukon schools continue to be safe and meet the needs of our students and staff now and into the future. As we plan for the new Whistle Bend elementary school and other school projects we will work closely with school communities and Yukon First Nations. I look forward to continuing our work together with our partners in education on these exciting school projects to provide modern learning spaces for Yukon students.</p>

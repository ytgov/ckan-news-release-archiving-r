<p>This is a difficult and emotional time for Yukon families of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, LGBTQ2S+ individuals, and survivors. I thank and commend them for sharing their personal experiences of this tragedy and educating all Canadians about its ongoing impacts. The strength and determination they have demonstrated, and their patience throughout this monumental task, will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>The Final Report of the Inquiry is a very complex document with hundreds of recommendations for how to address this tragedy. It has been a long time coming, but this chapter needed to be written. These women’s stories needed to be told, and all Canadians needed to hear them. We also need to respect and support those who chose not to share their stories at this time.</p>

<p>The Yukon government has supported the important work of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls since its launch. This is incredibly important work and it will take time and careful consideration to get it right. Together with our partners in the Yukon Advisory Committee we will review the Final Report and collaborate to build an action plan that will change the story for Yukon and Yukon families going forward.</p>

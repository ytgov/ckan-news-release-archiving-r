<p><em>Joint news release with the Government of Canada</em></p>

<p>A thriving economy needs strategic investments in modern green infrastructure to improve the lives of citizens while limiting impacts on the local environment. Investing in green infrastructure also helps create jobs and improve the quality of life of Northerners.</p>

<p>Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon; Yukon Minister of Community Services John Streicker; Mayor of the Village of Mayo Scott Bolton; Mayor of the City of Dawson Wayne Potoroka, and Mayor of Carmacks Lee Bodie, today announced funding for three water and wastewater projects across Yukon.</p>

<p>The first two projects will benefit residents in Mayo and Dawson City by upgrading underground infrastructure such as sanitary water mains, storm culverts, sewer mains and sewer services.</p>

<p>The third project involves updating the drinking water supply and installing a new water treatment system for the Carmacks recreation centre and arena. Upgrades for all three Yukon projects will ensure access to clean drinking water, better storm water management, and increased capacity for safely transporting sewage across the communities.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada is contributing over $9.3 million for the three projects under the Green Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Yukon is contributing over $3.1 million.</p>

<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<p>Modern water and wastewater infrastructure is essential to safeguarding the well-being of Yukoners and their families. Investing in green infrastructure is an essential part of building liveable, modern communities that will help protect the environment and keep northerners healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Drinking water and wastewater infrastructure often go unnoticed but they are critical to keeping municipalities running day-to-day. Our government is proud to partner with the Government of Canada to support projects that will provide essential upgrades to water and wastewater infrastructure in Mayo, Carmacks and Dawson City. Together we can ensure our communities remain health, vibrant and sustainable places for Yukoners to work and live.</p>

<p><strong>Minister of Community Services  John Streicker</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Village of Mayo is very thankful for the infrastructure funding dollars from the federal and territorial governments.  Small municipalities, such as Mayo, would not be able to proceed with their much needed infrastructure projects and upgrades without this funding.</p>

<p><strong>Mayor of the Village of Mayo  Scott Bolton</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Installing, replacing and updating essential infrastructure is necessary for municipalities and ensuring services are delivered in a safe, efficient manner. Pipes in the ground are vital for a healthy and growing community.</p>

<p><strong>Mayor of the City of Dawson  Wayne Potoroka</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The entire Village of Carmacks is very grateful to Canada for our new water plant which will service both our recreation centre as well as our new skating arena currently under construction. This will ensure all citizens have safe drinking water in a top-notch facility.</p>

<p><strong>Mayor of the Village of Carmacks  Lee Bodie</strong></p>

        <p>Through the <em>Investing in Canada</em> infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>Two billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity. In addition, $400 million is being delivered through the Arctic Energy Fund to advance energy security in the territories.</p>

        <p>On June 27, 2019, the Government of Canada launched two new strategies: Canada’s Connectivity Strategy, which commits to connect all Canadians to high-speed internet, and Canada’s first Rural Economic Development Strategy, which will spur economic growth and create good, middle class jobs for rural Canadians across the country.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.</p>

<p>Premier and Finance Minister Sandy Silver has tabled the Government of Yukon’s 2019–20 Budget.</p>

<p>The Budget focuses on affordable housing, effective health and social services, quality education, and reliable community infrastructure. This includes $19 million to develop building lots in Whitehorse and rural communities in each of the next five years.</p>

<p>Work will continue on the Health and Social Services Comprehensive Review to find efficiencies to better deliver services to Yukoners.</p>

<p>Additionally, construction will begin on the French first language secondary school and planning will begin on a new elementary school in Whistle Bend to meet the needs of a growing student population.</p>

<p>For the second year in a row, a Five-Year Capital Plan is included with the Budget to offer Yukoners, First Nations and municipal governments and the private sector a clearer picture of capital projects and priorities to allow for better planning.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon has appointed five members to form Yukon’s first Cannabis Licensing Board. This represents a significant step toward establishing the private cannabis retail model.</p>

<p>The <em>Cannabis Control and Regulations Act</em> provides the board with the sole authority to approve licences, determine licensing conditions, and hold hearings related to a licence application. The board is arm's-length from the Government of Yukon in its decision-making and authority.</p>

<p>The five Cannabis Licensing Board members are:</p>

<ul>
<li>David Sloan, chair;</li>
	<li>Mieke Leonard, vice-chair;</li>
	<li>Shari Borgford, member;</li>
	<li>John Farynowski, member; and</li>

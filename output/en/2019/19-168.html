<p>The Government of Yukon is releasing 76 lots by public lottery in the Whistle Bend subdivision. The lots include opportunities for single-family, duplex, townhouse and multi-family homes.</p>

<p>Many of the lots are smaller, which will make purchasing more attainable for people who are looking to build (or buy) a more affordable home. The average price for the 13 townhouse lots is $58,000 (per unit); the average price for the 10 duplex lots is $81,000 (per side); while the average price for the single-family lots is just over $90,000.</p>

<p>The lottery opens on July 30 and lottery applications will be accepted until 4:30 p.m. on August 27, 2019. The draw will take place in room 1A, 300 Main Street (Elijah Smith Building) at 1 p.m. on August 28, 2019.</p>

<p>Releasing these lots now will allow the new owners to begin development in the 2019 building season. Another 119 residential lots in Whistle Bend and some infill lots will be available by lottery this fall. Following these lotteries, work is underway to release commercial lots along Keno Way early in 2020, which will complete phases three and four of the Whistle Bend subdivision.</p>

<p>This latest release of lots continues the Government of Yukon’s efforts to increase land and housing availability to support healthy and vibrant communities. Increasing supply will result in more housing options in the future as commercial and private builders develop neighbourhoods in the territory.</p>

<p>For public safety there will be restricted access to view the 76 lots as they are in an active construction site. Please visit <a href="http://www.emr.gov.yk.ca/landmanagement">www.emr.gov.yk.ca/landmanagement</a> for details on directions, times and dates for property viewings.</p>

<p>The availability of good housing is critical both for quality of life and for our ability to grow businesses and recruit employees in Yukon. For this reason, we have increased our financial commitment to development in the past two years. The Government of Yukon will continue to work with other governments, the building trades and the real estate sector to find both short-term and longer-term solutions to land and housing availability in Yukon.  </p>

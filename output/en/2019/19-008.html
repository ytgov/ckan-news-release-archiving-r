<p>I would like to thank Jim Connell for his leadership and dedication to public service over these many years. As Deputy Minister with the Executive Council Office and Cabinet secretary he has helped our government fulfil many priorities aimed at improving the lives of Yukoners. He has mentored and guided me through these last two years and for that I am incredibly grateful.</p>

<p>I look forward to continuing to work with a very strong senior leadership team in the public service and I am confident that Stephen Mills, Paul Moore, Matt King, Paul McConnell and Nicole Morgan will continue to exhibit the skills and expertise that have made them all valuable assets to our organization.</p>

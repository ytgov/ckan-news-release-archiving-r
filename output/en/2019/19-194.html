<p><em>Joint news release – </em>A long-term, strategic vision for Canada’s Arctic and North</p>

<p>Today, the Honourable Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations launched Canada’s Arctic and Northern Policy Framework.</p>

<p>The framework sets out a long-term, strategic vision that will guide the Government of Canada’s activities and investments in the Arctic to 2030 and beyond and will better align Canada’s national and international policy objectives with the priorities of Indigenous peoples and Arctic and northern residents.</p>

<p>As the first policy framework of this scope to be co-developed with Indigenous, territorial, and provincial partners, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework demonstrates Canada’s commitment to working collaboratively. Co-development encompassed a broad spectrum of engagement and collaboration and enabled partners to contribute in varying ways, reflecting their own priorities and capacities. This inclusive approach will extend to implementation.</p>

<p>Through the framework, Canada is also supporting international cooperation that strengthens the rules-based international order in the Arctic and addresses the key challenges and opportunities impacting the people, economy and environment of Canada’s Arctic and North.</p>

<p>The framework takes an inclusive approach to the northern region and reflects the unique interests, priorities and circumstances of its people. As part of this approach, provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners were invited to develop chapters to the Framework that lay out their respective visions, aspirations and priorities.</p>

<p>In order to respect and support Inuit self-determination, an Inuit Nunangat chapter was developed as an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee deliverable. This chapter will guide how Arctic and Northern Policy Framework goals and objectives are implemented in Inuit Nunangat. In addition, territorial governments have authored chapters setting out their priorities for new investments and approaches in areas such as economic development, infrastructure and post-secondary education. Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut are also contributing a pan-territorial chapter that articulates their common challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p>The framework and partner chapters will form the foundation for future discussions as work on the framework enters its next phase, which focuses on co-development of implementation and governance moving towards more integrated federal-territorial-provincial and Indigenous approaches to challenges and opportunities in Canada’s Arctic and North. Partner chapters will be integral to this next step towards improving the quality of life for our Arctic and northern residents, especially for Indigenous people.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada will continue to build on these partnerships and investments to protect the land, support healthy communities, respect the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples, and nurture a strong, diversified, sustainable and dynamic economy in the Arctic and North.</p>

<p>We have listened to northerners about what they want, and we know that Arctic peoples and communities must be at the centre of this framework. In co-developing Canada’s Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, our partners helped us to understand and reflect the unique opportunities and challenges within the different regions, jurisdictional responsibilities and treaty rights across the Arctic and the North. Together, we have developed a shared vision for a strong, prosperous and sustainable Arctic, which will guide our work in the region to 2030 and beyond</p>

<p>The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework must be leveraged to bring Inuit Nunangat into Canada as a nation building exercise, helping to create prosperity for Inuit that in turn benefits all Canadians. Our homeland encompasses nearly one third of Canada’s landmass, its entire Arctic coastline and significant offshore areas. Partnerships that respect and advance Inuit self-determination, rights, and governance are therefore pivotal to achieving the framework’s goals and objectives, particularly at a time of renewed global focus on the Arctic. In the coming months, ITK looks forward to working in partnership with the federal government to advance the Framework’s important goals and objectives.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada recognizes that transportation is a major contributor to the economic growth and social wellbeing of Canada’s northern communities. Today’s launch of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework reflects our commitment to better address the unique transportation needs of the North. We have dedicated an additional $400 million, for a total of $800 million, under the National Trade Corridors Fund to strengthen northern transportation infrastructure. These investments will improve access to safe, efficient and accessible transportation options, and will help us deliver on our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities in the North and across Canada.</p>

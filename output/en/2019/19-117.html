<p>A new eight-unit affordable housing building officially opened at 1075 Third Avenue in Dawson City today. Tenants will be able to move in starting June 1, 2019.</p>

<p>The governments of Canada and Yukon provided $900,000 to the Klondike Development Organization through Yukon Housing Corporation programs to complete the project, which is the second affordable rental building completed in two years.</p>

<p>The two-storey design is similar to the previous affordable housing building with six 44-square-metre one-bedroom units, and two 55-square-metre two-bedroom units.</p>

<p>KDO is proud to be providing affordable rental housing solutions with the assistance of funding programs provided by CMHC and Yukon Housing Corporation, and important development incentives from the City of Dawson.  From a community-based economic development standpoint, this project checks several boxes: creating stable, year-round rentals support our labour market, and its Third Avenue location contributes to downtown revitalization as well as increased accessibility and minimized reliance on vehicle use.  We're especially pleased that this project was executed by local contractors and crews sourcing materials locally so that the development of this housing directly supports Dawson City's economy, particularly through the winter. </p>

        <p>The Government of Yukon supported this project with $500,000 from the Municipal Matching Rental Construction Grant and $400,000 from the Affordable Rental Construction Program. These Yukon Housing Corporation funding programs provide community organizations and developers with financial support to build affordable housing options for Yukoners.</p>

        <p>The Affordable Rental Construction Program was made possible under the Canada-Yukon Investment in Affordable Housing agreement. As part of the program to keep housing affordable, the new units must be rented at average, or below average market rent for the next 10 years.</p>

        <p>The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy (NHS)—a 10-year, $40 billion plan. The implementation of this plan will create 100,000 new housing units, and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as support the repair and renewal of more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.</p>

          <li class="field__item">
        <p>Thanks to new investments proposed in Budget 2019, Canada’s National Housing Strategy will be a 10-year, $55 billion plan that will give more Canadians a place to call home.</p>

          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The NHS is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments, and on continuous engagement with others including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and the social and private sectors to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians.</p>

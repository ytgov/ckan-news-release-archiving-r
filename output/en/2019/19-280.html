<p>The Government of Yukon is accepting lottery applications for 55 single-family residential lots in the Whistle Bend subdivision. Applications will be accepted until 4:30 p.m. on January 23, 2020. The draw will take place in Room 1A, 300 Main Street in the Elijah Smith Building at 10:00 a.m. on January 27, 2020.</p>

<p>Releasing these lots now will allow the new owners to plan and work with the City of Whitehorse on development applications over the winter to advance work on their lots for the 2020 building season.</p>

<p>The early snowfall and ongoing cold weather prevented the final stages of construction, mainly paving of roads, and some minor concrete and grading work. As a result, there will be a few conditions associated with the sale of these lots to allow the site contractor to complete work next year and for the subsequent turnover of the infrastructure to the City of Whitehorse.</p>

<p>These conditions include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restricted access during the lottery to the start of site construction. Vehicle access will be provided to the area, but access to the lots will be foot-access only along a cleared path.  </li>
	<li>No access for approximately two weeks in the spring while the contractor is on site to complete work. During this time, the area will be an active construction site and must be closed for safety reasons. Information about this shut down will be provided to lot owners and the public at that time.</li>
	<li>Allowing lot owners to apply for and work with the city on development permits, but postponing permit issuance until the city accepts the subdivision infrastructure, anticipated for mid-June to early July.</li>
</ul>
<p>This latest release of lots allows the Government of Yukon’s partnership with the City of Whitehorse to meet short-term demand and address future land development needs by increasing land and housing availability to support healthy and vibrant communities.</p>

<p>We are pleased to be working with the City of Whitehorse to continue the development of Whistle Bend and address housing pressures in Whitehorse. We know that people are anxious to build new homes and releasing lots now will give buyers time to plan for construction next summer. We look forward to releasing more lots in 2020.  </p>

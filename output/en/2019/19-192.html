<p>Ted Ackerman, a tutor-volunteer with Yukon Learn, and Kwanlin Dün First Nation Elder Louie Smith are this year’s recipients of the Council of the Federation Literacy Award. Premier Sandy Silver presented the tutor-learner pair with the award today in recognition of their contributions to literacy in the territory and the preservation of First Nation language, stories and history.</p>

<p>Louie Smith, now 86, was raised in the bush speaking Southern and Northern Tutchone and learning stories and history from his father. English is his third language. For almost four years Ted Ackerman has employed innovative approaches and technology to help Louie, who is visually impaired, fulfil his lifelong dream of learning to read in English.</p>

<p>In the process, Louie has taught Ted about First Nations culture as well as some Southern Tutchone. Together, with the permission of the Kwanlin Dün First Nation, they have preserved over 100 items of history and stories to contribute to the body of Yukon First Nations language revitalization and preservation work.</p>

<p>Ted and Louie have also become friends who share a strong passion for lifelong learning. They continue to meet for “school” twice a week at the Kwanlin Dün Kenädän Ku House of Learning.</p>

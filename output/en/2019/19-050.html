<p>We are pleased to see investments in education, infrastructure, and renewable energy and a commitment to advancing economic reconciliation reflected in the Government of Canada’s 2019–20 Budget.</p>

<p>Since taking office, our government has worked diligently to build strong, cooperative relationships with and among municipalities, Yukon First Nations and the Government of Canada. This new, collaborative approach has ensured a unified voice is presented to garner the federal government’s support, understanding and collaboration on a number of made-in-Yukon solutions and territorial priorities.</p>

<p>The budget includes proposed funding of $1.4 billion over seven years allocated for Loan Forgiveness and Reimbursement for Comprehensive Land Claims Negotiations. Having participated in a number of meetings about this long-standing issue, we are tremendously pleased to see it addressed as a part of economic reconciliation with Canada’s Indigenous people, including Yukon First Nations.</p>

<p>In addition, we are pleased to see up to $400 million committed for transportation infrastructure in the three territories. We look forward to learning more about how Yukon can access this increased funding to meet our infrastructure needs.</p>

<p>Federal Gas Tax funding has also been doubled for the next fiscal year. We are pleased to see this increase in funding that is vital to Yukon municipalities.</p>

<p>We also welcome the announcement of $75 million over five years for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency to enhance its economic development program. We are pleased to see the addition of $15 million over five years to support community-led projects for local and Indigenous food production systems under the Northern Isolated Community Initiatives Fund.</p>

<p>We are pleased to see included in the budget a continuation of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for five years to assist junior exploration companies to raise capital for early-stage exploration, as this is a valuable and important credit for Yukon’s mining industry.</p>

<p>We also welcome the announcement of up to $26 million for the construction of a new science building to support Yukon’s College’s transition to become the first in university in Canada’s North. This is an initiative we have had the pleasure of endorsing with many federal Ministers and we applaud the Government of Canada’s sustained commitment to research, education and training in Yukon.</p>

<p>There will also be an overall increase in federal transfers to Yukon of $50 million over the previous year. These investments are good news for Yukoners and reflect our strong working relationships with the federal government and our Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada’s 2019–20 Budget includes a number of important allocations for Yukon, which I believe are a direct result of the positive, collaborative relationships our government has established. I look forward to continuing to work together with our partners and the federal government on behalf of Yukoners to meet the needs of our northern communities.</p>

<p>With a new tourism strategy, it makes sense to evaluate and assess how we can best align the efforts of government and industry, improve efficiency and support sustainable tourism industry growth. We know there are different governance models in different jurisdictions in Canada and we want to make sure we have the one that makes sense for Yukon. We are proud to be working with industry partners and organizations to implement the new strategy.</p>

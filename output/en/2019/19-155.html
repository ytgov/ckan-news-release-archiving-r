<p>Three Yukoners have been appointed to form the territory’s first ever Independent Commission on Electoral Reform: Jessica Lott Thompson, Beverly Buckway and Jean-Sébastien Blais. Thompson has been appointed as Chair of the Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission is responsible for investigating and assessing options on three main areas of electoral reform: the system we use to elect the territorial government; the ways Yukoners participate in democracy both during and between elections; and how territorial political parties and elected officials operate before, during and after elections. The Commission’s work will also be informed by the priorities of Yukoners as identified through a public engagement on electoral reform that took place in the fall of 2018.</p>

<p>The Commission will receive administrative and research support to carry out their mandate from the Electoral Reform Secretariat. The Secretariat comprises public servants who will receive their guidance and direction from the Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission will be responsible for setting its own work schedule in order to provide a final report with recommendations by January 31, 2020.</p>

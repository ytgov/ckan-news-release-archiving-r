<p><em>Updated on October 3, 2019, with a correction to the number of survey participants and responses.</em></p>

<p><br>
	Yukoners are invited to share their experiences, ideas and thoughts on the territory’s health and social services systems at open houses in Yukon communities over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This public engagement is the second phase of Taking the Pulse: A Health and Wellness Conversation, the comprehensive review of Yukon’s health and social systems and programs. The review is led by the five-member Independent Expert Panel, which is made up of Yukoners and health systems experts from outside the territory.</p>

<p>The panel is releasing a discussion paper to generate further discussion during phase two of the engagement. It provides an overview of our current health and social system, as well as ideas suggested to the panel during phase one of the review.</p>

<p>The panel is also releasing a What We Heard report that summarizes the results of the first phase of public engagement, which took place from June to August 2019. It consisted primarily of meetings with health-care professionals, non-governmental organizations and community groups. In addition, the panel met with more than 120 Yukoners and received more than 120 responses to its survey.</p>

<p>In the weeks ahead, the panel is hosting open houses in the following communities: Beaver Creek, Burwash Landing, Carcross, Carmacks, Dawson, Faro, Haines Junction, Mayo, Old Crow, Pelly Crossing, Ross River, Teslin, Watson Lake and Whitehorse. These events are opportunities for Yukoners to share their ideas about how our health and social systems can improve, be more efficient, and meet Yukoners’ needs. Yukoners can also share their thoughts through an online survey on EngageYukon.ca.</p>

<p>We know that Yukoners are deeply invested in the health programs and services we offer, and we want to hear how the system can be improved to better meet their needs while being sustainable for decades to come. The Independent Expert Panel has done a tremendous amount of work over the past year and we thank them for engaging with Yukoners on how to shape the future of Yukon’s health and social systems. I encourage all Yukoners to read the discussion paper and What We Heard report and attend the upcoming open houses.</p>

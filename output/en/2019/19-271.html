<p>Five projects are underway in the Town of Watson Lake following the allotment of more than $1.65 million from the federal Gas Tax Fund.</p>

<p>With this funding, the Town of Watson Lake is buying new heavy equipment for road maintenance, installing a new groundwater monitoring well at the sewage lagoon and remediating the Brownfield area downtown.</p>

<p>Purchases of a new road grader and a new gravel truck with a plow will replace old equipment and help the Town of Watson Lake maintain its roads year-round and ensure public safety. This equipment will also allow the town to rehabilitate the existing road systems to address damage caused by weather and changing seasons. In addition, the Town of Watson Lake will purchase a new boom mower, which will help the municipality keep the solid waste facility and roadways clear of grass, willows and other trees.</p>

<p>Installing a new groundwater monitoring well for the town’s sewage lagoon will meet Government of Yukon’s requirement as part of its water licence renewal.</p>

<p>The Brownfield Redevelopment Project includes the demolition of the Watson Lake Hotel and several other buildings. Once the clearing and remediation of the site is complete planning for future projects will begin. Future development ideas may include a larger visitor information services facility, expanded signpost forest and increased recreational vehicle services for visitors to the community.   </p>

<p>All of the projects began in October 2019 with completion anticipated for March 2020.</p>

<p>The Gas Tax Fund is a reliable source of funding for municipalities to meet their local needs. It is great that the Town of Watson Lake is replacing aging road maintenance equipment, installing new protection for the environment and preparing to revitalize its town centre. These projects will create local jobs, provide an economic boost and lay the groundwork for expanded visitor services and attractions.  </p>

<p>On behalf of the Town of Watson Lake, we would like to thank and acknowledge the contribution to our infrastructure, aging equipment fleet and community beautification via the federal Gas Tax Fund. The community of Watson Lake is aging and these contributions will help our citizens with clear winter roads and clean drinking water for years to come. The fund is also helping us clean up our community in hopes of becoming a more attractive community to tourists.  </p>

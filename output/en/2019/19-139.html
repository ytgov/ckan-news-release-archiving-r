<p>Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee released the following statement:</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is committed to modernizing our education system and working with our education partners to ensure all students have the supports they need to succeed as learners. </p>

<p>Today’s release of the Office of the Auditor General of Canada’s audit report on inclusive and special education programs, and First Nations education in Kindergarten – Grade 12 education programs in Yukon provides us with clear direction on where we can improve our education system. We accept the recommendations of the Office of the Auditor General of Canada and recognize there is work to do to meet the needs of Yukon students.</p>

<p>We are working with Yukon First Nations governments and our partners in education to collaborate on achieving the audit’s recommendations. We are conducting a full review of the supports and services the Department of Education provides to students with special educational needs to determine how we can meet their education needs. We are also working with Yukon First Nations governments and the Government of Canada to renew our focus on the implementation of joint priorities for education to improve learning outcomes for First Nations students, as identified in the Joint Education Action Plan.</p>

<p>I thank the Office of the Auditor General of Canada for working with Yukon schools and the Department of Education to understand how we currently support students, and identifying inclusive and special education programs and First Nations education as areas that are most in need of improvement. Our government will continue to collaborate with our education partners across the territory to improve how we deliver education for all Yukon learners.</p>

<p>Improved service to Yukoners is the focus of 14 internal improvements identified in the first phase of the Health and Social Services Comprehensive Review.</p>

<p>The first phase of the review, which wrapped up at the end of January, included reviewing all programs and services delivered by the Department of Health and Social Services. This internal review identified several improvements, including: social assistance payments to be deposited directly into the bank accounts of clients; introducing electronic drug prescriptions for easier transmission to pharmacies; better use of the departmental clinical psychologist to work across the department; and introducing an online navigator to help individuals identify where they can go to seek assistance with the department.</p>

<p>The review also identified several internal efficiencies including streamlined internal processes around payment models, improved use of mobile devices and more flexible staffing.</p>

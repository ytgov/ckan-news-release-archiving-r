<p>A thriving economy needs strategic investments in green infrastructure to improve the lives of citizens while limiting impacts on the local environment. Investing in innovative green infrastructure also helps create jobs and improve the quality of life of Northerners.</p>

<p>Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell; Yukon Deputy Premier and Minister responsible for Yukon Energy Corporation and the Yukon Development Corporation Ranj Pillai; president and CEO of Yukon Energy Corporation Andrew Hall; and President, Director and CEO of Victoria Gold Corp John McConnell, today announced funding for two green infrastructure projects in Whitehorse and Mayo.</p>

<p>The first project will see the construction of a new battery energy storage system in the City of Whitehorse. Once completed, the new system will store the excess electricity generated by renewable sources during off-peak periods in order to meet demand during peak electrical loads. This new energy storage system will create a more reliable power supply and allow Yukon Energy Corporation to reduce fossil fuel consumption.</p>

<p>Funding will also go towards the replacement of a 31-kilometre section of the Mayo-McQuesten transmission line with a new higher capacity line to support future growth in the region. In addition to improving the quality and reliability of service to residents of Mayo and Keno, the upgraded transmission line will promote sustainable development in Yukon by providing hydro-generated electricity to industrial customers such as Victoria Gold, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada is investing more than $39.2 million in these projects through the Green Infrastructure Stream (GIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Yukon and the Yukon Energy Corporation are contributing more than $19.8 million in funding toward these strategic projects. </p>

<p>Investing in green infrastructure is an essential part of building liveable, modern communities. The new battery energy storage system and power line will allow the territory to more effectively manage its renewable energy resources while ensuring reliable services for residents in remote regions. This is an excellent example of what Yukoners can do when we work together at all levels of government to build stronger, more self-sustaining communities.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is committed to ensuring Yukon communities and businesses have access to safe, reliable and affordable energy. The Mayo-McQuesten transmission line upgrade project will improve the reliability of service on the grid and provide clean, renewable hydro-generated electricity to existing customers and future industrial customers. The Battery Energy Storage System will help address peak loads on Yukon’s electrical grid and allow for the addition of new renewable sources of energy. We are proud to partner with the Government of Canada and Yukon Energy Corporation on these two important projects that support Yukon’s commitment to a cleaner energy future.</p>

<p>Replacing the transmission line between Mayo and McQuesten, and installing a grid-scale battery in Whitehorse are critical to Yukon Energy’s ability to build the sustainable, reliable and affordable electricity system Yukoners need today and the robust energy system the territory needs to support growth in the future. Receiving government support of these projects reduces the impact of these critical investments on ratepayers and helps support the adoption of new technologies to address the unique challenges of energy supply on Yukon’s isolated grid.</p>

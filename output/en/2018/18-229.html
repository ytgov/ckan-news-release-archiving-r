<p>Yukon Housing Corporation’s rent supplement program is being increased by $200,000, with $100,000 dedicated to rent subsidies for Yukoners experiencing homelessness. The $1.4 million rent supplement program currently helps over 100 Yukon families to pay rent by providing a rent subsidy to individuals and families eligible for social housing who live in private market rental housing.</p>

<p>The expansion of the existing program will help more Yukoners access rental housing until 2020. It also supports the Government of Yukon’s efforts to implement the Safe at Home Community Based Plan to End and Prevent Homelessness along with the Housing Action Plan for Yukon.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada is committed to safe and affordable housing. That is why to help address urgent housing need in northern communities, our government is proud to partner with Yukon Housing Corporation on investments like the rent supplement program. It gives many Yukon families a much-needed boost, which in turn helps keep the local economy moving. It’s been an effective way for us to tackle housing affordability issues and I’m pleased to see it carried forward until 2020.</p>

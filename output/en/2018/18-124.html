<p><strong>Porter Creek Community Association </strong>– $115,080 – To expand the Pine Street Park in Porter Creek South and modernize its play equipment.

An expanded and enhanced park will accommodate the amount of young families who have moved to the neighbourhood in recent years. Contact:  Zara Soukoroff at (867) 335-3667.</p>

<p><strong>Ross River Dena Council</strong> – $90,000 – To determine the feasibility of developing a Community/Language Centre in Ross River. Based on the results of the feasibility study, phase two will develop a business plan and preliminary financial analysis.

<p><strong>Carcross/Tagish First Nation</strong> – $92,965 – To provide landscaping training and job skills development to six C/TFN citizens. The project aims to equip the local labour force with skill sets needed to meet future local employment opportunities in site reclamation and landscaping and to support the transfer and practice of First Nation traditional knowledge. The project also creates a sustainable learning environment for community members and visitors as the landscape around the Learning Centre is intended to become a cultural programming “classroom” where knowledge on indigenous plants and their traditional use will be shared. The project will create approximately 2,480 hours of employment for eight people. Contact:  Nelson Lepine at (867) 393-2356.</p>

<p><strong>Selkirk First Nation</strong> – $297,525 – To complete renovations to the Link Building and community hall including kitchen upgrades, barrier-free washrooms and an exit door in order to meet safety and code regulations as well as community needs.

The project will create approximately 4,350 hours of employment for ten people. Contact:  Marta Selassie at (867) 993-7400.</p>

<p><strong>Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in</strong> – $ 62,640 – To develop construction-ready architectural drawings in consultation with geotechnical, structural, mechanical and electrical engineers, remove vermiculite and replace fuel tank in preparation for future renovations of the Youth Centre. This project contributes to the long term goal of having a youth centre that provides healthy and active programming for the youth of Dawson City.  Such programming supports the development of youths’ potential and provides alternative to violence, substance use and crime.  Contact:  Gwyneth Williams or Peter Marangu at (867) 993-7100.</p>

<p><strong>Polarettes &amp; Polar Tumblers Gymnastics Club</strong> – $ 82,364 – To replace and upgrade gymnastics specific training equipment. The replacement of the gymnastics equipment will have a significant impact on the training environment for the elite gymnasts and will benefit all users of the facility by ensuring equipment is up to current standards.  It will enable the club to host national events and assist Yukon in hosting the 2020 Arctic Winter Games. Contact:  Kimberly Jones at (867) 668-4794.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Ties Four Directions Centre Society</strong> – $100,000 – To construct five tiny housing units on one downtown city lot that will provide supported housing to Whitehorse's most vulnerable community members.

<p>Crime Prevention and Victim Services Trust Spring 2018 Recipients</p>

<p><strong>Village of Teslin – $11,500 for 2018 Summer Programming</strong></p>

<p>The Village of Teslin is providing weekday camps and afternoon and evening programming for children and youth from June 15 to August 31, 2018 in Teslin and surrounding areas. Three week-long day camps will include Elephant Thoughts science camp, Breakdance Yukon Society dance camp and Monkey Business gymnastics camp. The project goals are to reduce the incidence of crime by offering children and youth in Teslin a safe place to go during the summer month to be active, mentally engaged and learn new skills.<br>
	 </p>

<p><strong>Big Brothers Big Sisters of Yukon – $12,000 for Community Mentoring Project</strong></p>

<p>The Big Brothers Big Sisters of Yukon is building and augmenting its mentoring program in Dawson City and Whitehorse through volunteer recruitment, safety training and case management and mentorship monitoring. The goal of the project is to build program capacity to provide a mentor for each child who would like one in the Yukon. The mentoring program matches an adult with a child to create a fun and safe friendship so that the child feels valued and has a friend to talk to. The program participants go on outings, meet at the child’s home or partake in activities offered through school.<br>
	 </p>

<p><strong>Blood Ties Four Directions Centre Society – $15,936 for Landlords Working to End Homelessness after-hours support</strong></p>

<p>The Landlords Working to End Homelessness (LWEH) program provides vulnerable and “hard-to-house” clients with housing and ongoing support services in order to help them become successful tenants. A sponsor organization leases a renal unit on behalf of a client and assumes responsibility for ensuring the client is good tenant. A pilot project is currently working to collaboratively partner with agencies to expand the program with on-call, after-hours and weekend client supports. The hope is that more landlords will be willing to enter into tenancy agreements if there are more supports in place to help tenants in crisis on evenings and weekends. LWEH was started by Blood Ties Four Directions Centre in 2013 and has been adopted by the Victoria Faulkner Women’s Centre, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Society Yukon and Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition.<br>
	 </p>

<p><strong>Dawson Shelter Society – $7,535.30 for Wen-do Women’s Self Defence sessions and workshops</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yukon Tourism Education Council - $34,000 for Youth Program Summer Camp</strong></p>

<p>The spring sitting of the Yukon Legislative Assembly concluded today. The 30-day session began with the delivery of the 2018–19 Budget, which features a five-year capital plan, profiling the Government of Yukon’s priority infrastructure projects. Highlights of the budget include $42 million in municipal and First Nation infrastructure; over $43 million to complete construction and begin operation of the Whistle Bend Continuing Care Facility; over $11 million in energy retrofits; nearly $40 million for housing and land development to meet Yukon’s housing needs; and over $60 million worth of seasonally-dependent construction tenders.  </p>

<p>In addition to the Budget, several substantial pieces of legislation have been granted assent during the spring sitting, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bill 15, the <em>Cannabis Control and Regulation Act,</em> governs the distribution, retail, consumption, personal cultivation and possession of non-medical cannabis in Yukon. It puts a priority on health, safety and harm reduction with a focus on protecting youth from negative health effects;</li>
	<li>Bill 17, the <em>Gender Diversity and Related Amendments Act,</em> developed to make Yukon laws, policies, programs and services as non-discriminatory and inclusive as possible; and</li>
	<li>Bill 18, the <em>Order of Yukon Act</em>, established an award that allows Yukoners to formally recognize those individuals who have made a significant contribution to the territory and well-being of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the spring sitting the Government of Yukon announced permanent funding for the American Sign Language program as well as the Community Wellness Court, and provided funding for the creation of an RCMP Historical Cases Unit and a Gladue report writing pilot project.  The government also released 80 lots in Whistle Bend in time for the 2018 building season, created 10 new long-term care bedrooms at Whitehorse’s Thomson Centre, opened four Mental Wellness Hubs in Yukon communities and provided funding for the first-ever Yukon Innovation Hub.</p>

<p>The fall sitting is scheduled to begin in the first week of October, 2018.</p>

<p>We have put forward a strong budget that supports programs and services that will improve the lives of Yukoners. Our whole-of-government approach to building healthy, vibrant and sustainable communities is showing results. Yukon has had the lowest unemployment in the country for months now.  The economy is finally turning the corner and is expected to grow substantially in the coming years. We will continue to focus on infrastructure, housing, mental wellness and building strong, respectful relationships with our partners so that all Yukoners can benefit from this economic growth.</p>

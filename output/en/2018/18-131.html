<p><em>joint news release with the Government of Canada and the City of Dawson</em></p>

<p>Residents of Dawson City celebrated the grand opening of their new Minto Park concession building with a community event on June 8. The original facility was destroyed by fire in 2015.</p>

<p>The concession building will be a venue for fitness, recreational and leisure programming in a safe and healthy environment. The new facility includes a kitchen, a multi-use room and public washrooms.</p>

<p>Minto Park is a designated municipal historical site with a long history as the location for many of Dawson City’s community events, celebrations and sports activities.</p>

<p>The City of Dawson accessed $511,000 of its federal Gas Tax Fund money to construct the new concession building. It also received $200,000 from the Government of Yukon’s Community Development Fund. Money from insurance policies, as well as from the City of Dawson, were also used to pay for the construction.</p>

<p>Minto Park is in the heart of Dawson and over the years I have seen pick-up soccer, road hockey on the basketball court, kids climbing, teens skateboarding and most recently cricket! Not to mention all of the dancing and amazing music at the Dawson City Music Festival. We are proud to work together with the City of Dawson and excited for residents to enjoy this new concession building.</p>

        <p>Design of the new concession building began in 2016 with construction starting in 2017 and completed this spring. Final landscaping details remain.</p>

        <p>Beginning in 1895, the original Minto Park took nine years to complete.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>Before its completion in 1905, the park was given its name in 1904, after the 4th Earl of Minto, the first Governor General to visit the Yukon.</p>

          <li class="field__item">
        <p>Dawson City was the territory’s capital from 1902 to 1953. Minto Park is located between 5th and 7th avenues and next to the Old Territorial Administration Building – currently the Dawson City Museum. As Yukon’s first formal park, it was designed to complement the style of architecture of the territory’s legislative and administrative headquarters.</p>

          <li class="field__item">
        <p>In addition to the formal gardens, Minto Park also includes a baseball diamond, a tennis court, a playground and a cement skate park. It is currently used for athletic events, military drills, community celebrations and other public events.</p>

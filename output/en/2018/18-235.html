<p>As anticipated during the Spring 2017 Budget speech, the Government of Yukon’s non-consolidated public accounts for 2017–18 show a surplus.</p>

<p>The non-consolidated annual surplus for the year was $18.7 million in comparison to the budgeted surplus of $6.5 million. The change in the surplus resulted primarily from higher-than-estimated revenues of $1.1 million, and lower-than-anticipated expenses of $10.2 million – a variance of less than one per cent.</p>

<p>On a non-consolidated basis, revenues increased by $40 million from 2016–17 to 2017–18, mainly as a result of increases in the formula financing, and other grants, contributions and service agreements with the Government of Canada.</p>

<p>At the start of the 2017–18 fiscal year, the Government of Yukon had net financial assets totalling $88 million. During 2017–18, net financial assets decreased by $51 million to $37 million, primarily due to continued investment in the development of buildings, infrastructure and other tangible capital assets.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is taking a three-pronged approach towards establishing a more strategic and sustainable method of fiscal planning. This includes a comprehensive review of programs and services delivered by the Department of Health and Social Services, a review of internal efficiencies, and a commitment to explore opportunities for government to get out of the business of doing business.</p>

<p>The public accounts are audited by the Auditor General of Canada and have received an unqualified audit opinion.</p>

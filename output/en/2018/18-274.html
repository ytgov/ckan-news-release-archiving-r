<p>The Government of Yukon and The Salvation Army have reached an agreement in principle to transfer the ownership and operations of the Centre of Hope to the Government of Yukon. The agreement is subject to Management Board approval.</p>

<p>The agreement in principle was reached through a collaborative process undertaken between the two parties. Both organizations have a keen interest in ensuring that vulnerable and at risk Yukoners receive the services and supports that they need, and that interest has been a driving force in this process.</p>

<p>Throughout the remainder of December and January, Health and Social Services staff will begin working side-by-side with Salvation Army staff to facilitate the transition of services. At the end of January, ownership of the building will transfer to Government of Yukon with Health and Social Services taking on full oversight of services and programming.  </p>

<p>Our government has been working in partnership with the Salvation Army to support operations at the Centre of Hope since it opened. Together we recognize that the services provided at the Centre are not meeting the unique needs of our community. As a result, we have come to a mutual agreement to transfer the building and program operations to the Government of Yukon. The transfer of services will allow The Salvation Army to focus on other roles within the community. We look forward to continuing to work with them to support those in need in our community.</p>

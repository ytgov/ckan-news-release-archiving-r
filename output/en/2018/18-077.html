<p><em>Joint news release with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</em></p>

<p>Federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for housing met today to endorse a multilateral Housing Partnership Framework* (Partnership), further advancing the National Housing Strategy (NHS) and setting the foundation for federal, provincial and territorial governments to work together toward achieving a long-term shared vision for housing.</p>

<p>Federal, provincial and territorial governments are primary partners in housing, and have a shared responsibility and complementary roles for housing.  This is why together, under the Partnership, the federal, provincial and territorial governments will work together to help make housing more affordable and accessible through the following initiatives: the Canada Housing Benefit, the Canada Community Housing Initiative, Provincial/Territorial Priority Funding, and funding for the northern territories. </p>

<p>As part of the Partnership, ministers responsible for housing agreed that governments will achieve better housing outcomes by sharing data and information that will make program development and delivery more effective, collaborating with diverse stakeholders and aligning housing policies and planning with other sectors to create effective housing solutions and vibrant communities. </p>

<p>Provinces and territories will be invited to participate in federal programs designed to increase affordable housing supply, such as the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, by supporting decision-making and co-investing.</p>

<p><em>*Québec stated that:</em></p>

<p><em>While it shares many of the objectives sought by other governments, Québec intends to fully exercise its own responsibilities and control over the planning, organization and management of housing on its territory to benefit Québec's population. Accordingly, Québec does not subscribe to the National Housing Strategy (NHS) and hopes to undertake discussions as soon as possible to reach an asymmetrical bilateral agreement – distinct from the NHS – which will fully respect Québec’s exclusive responsibility in the area of housing and allows Québec to obtain its share of all federal funding dedicated to housing.</em></p>

<p>Today’s endorsement of the Partnership marks a significant step forward to realizing the vision and bold outcomes of the National Housing Strategy. The Government of Canada, together with provincial and territorial governments, are investing more than $40 billion, to protect, repair and expand community housing for vulnerable Canadians, including urban indigenous people, women and girls. Together we will make affordable housing more available, accessible and appropriate to help Canadians meet their needs.</p>

        <p>Announced on National Housing Day, November 22, 2017, the National Housing Strategy (NHS) is an ambitious 10-year, $40-billion plan that will remove 530,000 families from housing need and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.</p>

      </li>
          <li class="field__item">
        <p>The NHS is built on strong partnership between the federal, provincial and territorial governments and continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, regional Indigenous governments and organizations, national Indigenous organizations and the social and private sectors. This involves consultations with Canadians from all walks of life, including people with lived experience of housing need.</p>

        <p>All NHS investments delivered by the federal, provincial and territorial governments will respect the key principles of the National Housing Strategy that support partnerships, people and communities.

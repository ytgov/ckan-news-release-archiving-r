<p>The Government of Yukon released a What We Heard document today that summarizes the key findings of its public engagement on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).</p>

<p>The public engagement took place from May 2017 through February 2018. Representatives from the FASD Interagency Advisory Committee travelled to nine Yukon communities to meet with identified stakeholders, including First Nation and municipal governments, service providers and community members.</p>

<p>The information gathered through this engagement is now being considered by the territorial government as it develops a Yukon FASD Action Plan.</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone who took part in our engagement sessions for their honesty and openness. Overall, we heard that Yukoners lack awareness and understanding about FASD, and that people are frustrated by lack of support in their communities. This government is dedicated to changing that. This valuable input will guide us as we work collectively to take better care of one of Yukon’s most vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>Through interactive discussions, the FASD interagency committee learned about the many strengths in Yukon communities and that communities are wanting to, and are able to, lead the work to address issues around FASD within their community. A collaborative approach between First Nations governments, local and territorial governments, NGOs and community agencies is thought to be the best approach to address the issues for people living with FASD, their families and their communities.</p>

        <p>FASD may be Yukon’s leading preventable cause of non-genetic intellectual disability.

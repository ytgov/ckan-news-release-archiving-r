<p>Five community-based projects to help prevent violence against Indigenous women and girls are receiving a total of $148,000 in funding from the Prevention of Violence against Aboriginal Women Fund.</p>

<p>The projects aim to address and prevent violence against Indigenous women and girls in Yukon communities through various initiatives, including raising awareness, healing and educational opportunities.</p>

<p>The Prevention of Violence against Aboriginal Women Fund is administered by the Women’s Directorate. Applicants can apply for up to $25,000 for 1-year projects or $50,000 for 2-year projects that are community-based and designed and developed by and for Indigenous women in Yukon. Yukoners with ideas for projects that meet the criteria are encouraged to contact the fund administrator when they see advertisements for the annual Call for Proposals in late fall.</p>

<p>Gender-based violence remains a perpetual barrier to true gender equality in Yukon, and Indigenous women and girls continue to be vulnerable to this kind of violence. These projects demonstrate a number of innovative approaches to supporting victims of violence and their families through culturally-competent and community-based initiatives.</p>

<p>When the Sally and Sisters/Soeurs lunch program started eight years ago, we brought together a number of NGO's who were concerned about women and children's access to a safe and sober place for lunch. We relied on the community for support through a letter writing campaign. Having stable funding from the Prevention of Violence against Aboriginal Women program provided by the Women’s Directorate is key to our ongoing ability to provide a hot lunch in a welcoming space at the Food Bank. We really appreciate the support and those who come for lunch do too!</p>

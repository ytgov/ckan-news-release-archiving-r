<p><em>Joint news release with Status of Women Canada</em></p>

<p>By working in a spirit of collaboration, federal, territorial and provincial governments have an exceptional opportunity to help advance gender equality across Canada.</p>

<p>Today, the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Canada’s Minister of Status of Women, and the Honourable Jeanie Dendys, Yukon’s Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate, announced a joint funding collaboration that will support three Indigenous women’s organizations in Yukon: the Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society, the Whitehorse Aboriginal Women’s Circle, and the Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council.</p>

<p>Government of Yukon currently provides $759,000 in operational funding over three years to the three Indigenous women’s organizations. Status of Women Canada will be providing an additional $867,500 over three years to support activities related to the development and implementation of strategic planning processes, organizational skills development, enhanced human resources, partnership and communications strategies, and other capacity-building activities. The combined funding of over $1.6 million dollars will be dedicated to improving the capacity of these three organizations to address systemic issues impacting Indigenous women in Yukon.</p>

<p>This joint funding announcement comes on the heels of the Government of Canada’s announcement of a major investment in the sustainability of the women’s movement across Canada. Status of Women Canada’s latest call for proposals, entitled Capacity-building Fund, will grant funding to women’s organizations, and Indigenous organizations serving women, to increase their organizational and sector capacity, allowing them to participate in activities such as skills development and community engagement. The fund, which stems from the Budget 2018 announcement of $100 million over five years, will help support a viable and enduring women’s movement across Canada.</p>

<p>At last year’s meeting of Federal-Provincial-Territorial (FPT) Ministers Responsible for the Status of Women a commitment was made to seek opportunities for collaboration between orders of governments to better support organizations working for gender equality. This announcement stems from this commitment and is the first of several joint funding agreements that will be announced in the coming months between the Government Canada and territorial and provincial governments across the country.</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p>When we advance gender equality, we grow Canada’s economy and create safer communities, but no order of government can do this work alone. That’s why I am so pleased to work with the Government of Yukon to help make this important investment in three Indigenous women’s organizations that reflects local needs and priorities. Canadians expect us to work together, and by pooling our resources, the federal and provincial and territorial governments can ensure that our investments make the biggest impact and that women’s organizations across Canada can continue advancing gender equality, supporting our middle class and those working hard to join it, and creating lasting change that benefits all Canadians.</p>

<p><strong>The Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister of Status of Women</strong></p>

<p>These three women’s organizations provide critical advocacy, support and leadership that breaks down barriers and empowers Yukon Indigenous women and girls. We are pleased to partner with the Government of Canada to provide these organizations with stable, flexible funding that will help them meet the needs of Indigenous women and girls throughout Yukon.</p>

<p><strong>The Honourable Jeanie Dendys, Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate</strong></p>

<p>The Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society would like to thank the Governments of Canada and Yukon for helping us to maintain a strong and continuing presence in support of Indigenous women in Yukon and Northern British Columbia. The contributions will assist us in ensuring our capacity to serve while continuing in our quest for a stable source of long-term core funding.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Maje Raider, executive director of the Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society</strong></p>

<p>Today’s announcement is welcome news for Indigenous women in Whitehorse. Thanks to the funding from the Governments of Canada and Yukon we will be able to build capacity within our organization so we can better support Indigenous women in our city.</p>

<p><strong>Krista Reid, president of the Whitehorse Aboriginal Women’s Circle</strong></p>

<p>Indigenous women hold important places as leaders in their families and communities. Thanks to this support from the Governments of Canada and Yukon, we will be in a better position to help empower Indigenous women across Yukon, which will strengthen families and communities throughout our territory.</p>

<p><strong>Terri Szabo, president of the Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council</strong></p>

<p><strong>Status of Women Canada – Women’s Program</strong></p>

<p>One of the ways Status of Women Canada advances gender equality is by providing funding to eligible organizations through the Women’s Program. Projects are selected via calls for proposals on specific themes, as well as through a continuous intake process that allows the Women’s Program to address emerging issues as they arise.</p>

<p>The Women’s Program provides funding to projects that address barriers to women’s participation and equality in Canadian society in three priority areas: ending violence against women and girls; improving the economic security of women and girls; and encouraging women and girls in leadership roles.</p>

<p><strong>Joint funding with the Government of Yukon</strong></p>

<p>The funding represents a strategic investment on behalf of Status of Women Canada of $867,500 to augment the $759,000 committed by the Government of Yukon’s Women’s Directorate through the Indigenous Women’s Equality Fund over three years. The Government of Yukon will administer the funds and flow the investment to the recipient organizations.</p>

<p>The joint funding collaboration will support three Indigenous women’s organizations in the territory: the Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society, Whitehorse Aboriginal Women’s Circle, and the Yukon Aboriginal Women’s Council.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon identified support for these three organizations as a key partnership opportunity to increase access to funding, in the context of priorities identified by the Federal-Provincial-Territorial (FPT) Ministers Responsible for the Status of Women. The Government of Yukon relies on the expertise and experience of these organizations to inform program, policy and legislative development that advances Indigenous women’s equality.</p>

<p><strong>Project Description</strong></p>

<p>The additional funds will be dedicated to improving the organizational capacity of these organizations to strengthen their ability to address issues impacting Indigenous women. The funding will cover costs related to the development and implementation of strategic planning processes, organizational skills development, enhanced human resources, partnership and communications strategies, and other capacity-building activities.</p>

<p>Health and Social Services Minister Pauline Frost has announced the members of an independent, expert panel to provide strategic advice and expertise as part of the Health and Social Services Comprehensive Review.</p>

<p>The review will include assessing all programs and services delivered by Health and Social Services and the Yukon Hospital Corporation, as well as those funded by the department and delivered by non-government organizations. The panel will look at how services are organized, managed and delivered, and will look to find efficiencies to better deliver services to Yukoners.</p>

<p>Over the coming months Yukoners, First Nations governments and non-governmental organizations will have the opportunity to provide input and feedback into the review. A final report is expected to be developed by late 2019.</p>

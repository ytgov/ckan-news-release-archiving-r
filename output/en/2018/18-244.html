<p>The Government of Yukon received 20 proposals during its first call for projects under the Housing Initiatives Fund.</p>

<p>Seven projects currently have signed transfer agreements in place and three others have received commitments for funding from the $3.6 million fund. Over the next 18 months, these projects will bring over 100 homes to Yukoners that will remain as affordable housing for 20 years.</p>

<p>The selected projects will increase the supply of new housing units in Whitehorse, Carcross, Pelly Crossing, Haines Junction, Teslin and Carmacks. Recipients include the Teslin Tlingit Council for the construction of eight units in Teslin and Ramza Development Ltd. for 18 units in Whitehorse.</p>

<p>The Housing Initiatives Fund supports a wide range of new affordable housing projects that align with the three pillars of the Housing Action Plan for Yukon: housing with support services, affordable rental housing and increased home ownership options.</p>

<p>The next call for housing projects will be in January 2019.</p>

<p>We designed the Housing Initiatives Fund to increase the amount of affordable and supportive housing available to Yukoners. We have received a tremendous response from First Nations governments, local organizations and developers interested in providing people with innovative housing options across the territory, and we will continue to broaden our partnerships with housing providers through the Housing Initiatives Fund going forward.</p>

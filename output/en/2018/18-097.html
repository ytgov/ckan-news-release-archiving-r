<p><em>Joint news release with the Government of Canada</em></p>

<p>The governments of Canada and Yukon are working together to make long-term infrastructure investments that will create jobs and economic growth, build inclusive communities and support a low carbon, green economy – leading to a higher quality of life for Northern Canadians.</p>

<p>Today, the Honourable Amarjeet Sohi, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, and the Honourable Sandy Silver, Premier of Yukon, announced the signing of a bilateral agreement that will provide more than $594 million over the next decade in shared funding for infrastructure projects under the Investing in Canada plan. The Government of Canada is providing a total of over $445 million, up to 75 per cent of eligible expenditures. The projects supported through this agreement will be cost-shared with the territorial government, municipalities, First Nations and other partners. This higher cost share takes into consideration the unique challenges faced by the territories. As well, Indigenous recipients can use additional federal funding from other sources to a maximum federal contribution of 100 per cent on projects.</p>

<p>The <em>Investing in Canada</em> plan will see the governments of Canada and Yukon make unprecedented investments in green infrastructure, recreational, cultural, and community infrastructure, rural and northern communities’ infrastructure, and public transit.</p>

<p>These investments will make a positive difference for people across the territory, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>clean air and water;</li>
	<li>reduced greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
	<li>energy security and reduced reliance on diesel in the North;</li>
	<li>smarter and more efficient communities;</li>
	<li>sustainable water and wastewater management;</li>
	<li>cultural spaces that make communities great places to live;</li>
	<li>better transportation and digital infrastructure for people living in remote communities; and</li>
	<li>better movement of people and goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Across Canada more than $33 billion in federal funding will be invested through these new bilateral agreements with provinces and territories. Provinces and territories will develop three-year plans that will provide information on how they will implement their infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>I am pleased that Yukon and the Government of Canada have reached an agreement that will benefit communities across the territory for years to come. Today’s agreement will provide the long-term predictable funding required to meet the unique challenges of life in the North. Investments in infrastructure are key to building a strong Canada—connecting people, creating jobs and strengthening our economy and communities for the future. I look forward to continuing to work with our territorial, municipal and Indigenous partners to make strategic investments in Yukon that will build inclusive, resilient communities where everyone has opportunities to succeed.</p>

<p>Building infrastructure is challenging and expensive in Yukon given our short construction season, limited resources, and changing climate. This agreement provides us with the assurance of long-term funding for infrastructure in our territory, allowing us to plan well into the future. The Government of Yukon will continue to partner with municipalities and First Nations to identify local solutions to local priorities that will benefit our economy and the well-being of all our communities.</p>

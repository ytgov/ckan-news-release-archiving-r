<p>Premier Sandy Silver and Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai have returned from the Vancouver Investment Conference and Mineral Exploration Roundup, both of which were held in Vancouver last week.</p>

<p>The Invest Yukon Pavilion at the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference – a showcase of Yukon-based projects, companies and investment partners – was operated by the Yukon Mining Alliance. On Sunday, January 21, Premier Silver spoke there to a standing room-only crowd about investment opportunities in the territory. The Government of Yukon was proud to support the Yukon Mining Alliance as part of their effort in Vancouver.</p>

<p>In addition to giving technical talks and showcasing Yukon’s mineral industry at Roundup, the Government of Yukon supported the Yukon First Nation Chamber of Commerce, who hosted a successful Energy and Mining Forum. This event brought together First Nation development corporations, mining industry executives and government officials to identify opportunities and challenges in Yukon. Minister Pillai provided opening remarks for the forum, while the Premier spoke at the event’s evening reception.</p>

<p>Government officials also attended Yukon Night – an event hosted by the Yukon Chamber of Mines to celebrate Yukon’s unique minerals history, culture and its commitment to innovation in mining and exploration. There, Premier Silver and the Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston spoke of their appreciation for the event and welcomed the audience to one of Roundup’s most popular gatherings.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon would like to thank the Yukon Chamber of Mines, Yukon Mining Alliance, the Yukon First Nation Chamber of Commerce and the Yukon Chamber of Commerce for their commitment and dedication on behalf of Yukoners to the promotion of mineral investment and exploration in Yukon.</p>

<p>We are very pleased with the turnout at this year’s Invest Yukon Pavilion at the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference, which kicked off this past Sunday with more than 200 delegates in attendance for opening remarks. Yukon Mining Alliance’s ‘Klondike Trail’ has expanded from 6 Yukon companies in 2011 to 15 this year, with the Invest Yukon Pavilion recognized as one of the busiest showcases of the conference. After seven years of strategically highlighting Yukon’s investment potential, the Yukon Mining Alliance, Government of Yukon and Yukon companies are seeing a significant return on their investment in the distinctive Invest Yukon marketing model.</p>

<p>This was an exciting and busy week for our organization and our members. We hit a key milestone by hosting our 5th Anniversary Mining &amp; Energy Forum where attendees continued to advance discussions on active engagement, collaboration and business opportunities between Yukon First Nation Development Corporations, Aboriginal Businesses and the minerals industry. We were also pleased to join Yukon Mining Alliance and Yukon mining companies, to share the story of Yukon’s mineral investment opportunities at the Invest Yukon Pavilion during the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference.</p>

<p>AME Roundup brought all sectors of Yukon’s mineral exploration industry together with a strong presence from Yukon First Nations and Yukon Government which provided a unified and powerful message to the global geological and investment industry. The burgeoning and successful model of collaboration in Yukon projects was the theme to an attendance of over 6000 this year at AME Roundup which resonated with attendees and will last long after this year’s conference.</p>

<p>The Government of Yukon is pleased to introduce Yukon’s Action Plan for over $7 million in early learning and child care funding. This funding stems from the new Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, signed February 7. </p>

<p>One of the main areas that funding will be provided for is improving quality through training. $60,000 will be allocated to an annual two-day professional development-training event to provide an opportunity for early childhood educators across Yukon to share best practices and access training and professional development opportunities. </p>

<p>Another $100,000 will be utilized to support students enrolled in recognized early childhood education courses with the cost of their education. $270,000 will be allocated to support education for early childhood educators in the communities through Yukon College and $220,000 will be allotted to developing and implementing culturally appropriate programming for early childhood development and education from ages 0-5.</p>

<p>Funding will also be allocated to three other main areas of early learning and childcare: improving affordability and accessibility; innovation; and providing inclusive child care programs.  </p>

<p>This funding complements the previously announced increase to the Direct Operating Grant.</p>

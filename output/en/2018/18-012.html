<p>Yukoners are encouraged to share their thoughts, ideas and suggestions on how to sustainably grow tourism in the territory through a new public engagement process launched today by Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys.</p>

<p>Minister Dendys was joined by Rich Thompson, co-chair of the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy Steering Committee, at an event today to unveil the engagement sessions. The sessions will be held in communities throughout the territory with First Nations governments, municipalities, tourism businesses, partner organizations and the public. In addition, feedback can be provided online.</p>

<p>Tourism is a key component of Yukon’s economy, providing employment for Yukoners and supporting vibrant communities across the territory while balancing economic development with environmental, community and cultural values.</p>

<p>The results of the online survey and community meetings will inform the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy, which will help form plans to achieve growth opportunities and priorities.</p>

<p>Tourism is so much more than a strong contributor to Yukon’s economy – it helps us share our culture, our stories and our connection to the land with visitors and residents. Tourism supports our communities, our businesses and touches most of us in one way or another. I invite all Yukoners to share their thoughts and get involved so we can build the Tourism Development Strategy together.</p>

<p>Tourism is and will remain very important to the Yukon economy. Through full engagement and sharing of ideas, we hope to be able to develop some bold strategic ideas on how to make the industry better for all the stakeholders that it impacts.

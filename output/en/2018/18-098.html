<p><em>Joint news release with Northwest Territories Tourism </em></p>

<p>The three Canadian territories are launching a new Business, Market and Trade Ready Learning Program to help northern tourism suppliers increase their global competitiveness when selling their products and experiences.</p>

<p>The program outlines tourism sector standards for the three levels of readiness (business, market and trade) and provides insights, explanations and examples for businesses to utilize and incorporate in their operations. The resources will help businesses establish and maintain consumer confidence through the development of consistent policies and processes. It is also aimed at growing capacity in the tourism industry and promoting a better understanding of the opportunities and requirements of working within the travel trade.</p>

<p>This program is available for tourism suppliers online and through in-person workshops conducted in Canada’s North. Participants who complete the workshop – either online or in a classroom setting – will gain a deeper understanding of how to enhance their readiness and make successful connections with consumers in a global marketplace.</p>

<p>To request a workshop, Yukon organizations and communities are encouraged to contact the Industry Services unit of the Government of Yukon’s Department of Tourism and Culture.</p>

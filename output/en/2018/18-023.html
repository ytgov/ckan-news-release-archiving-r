<p>The Community Midwifery Association Yukon will receive $74,360 from the Government of Yukon’s Community Development Fund to research and document historic birth knowledge and culture.</p>

<p>The project will involve interviewing First Nations’ citizens and midwives throughout the territory in order to document stories of past midwifery practices. The information will be published in a booklet. The association hopes the project will honour and revitalize indigenous midwifery in Yukon.</p>

<p>Dr. Rachel Olson, a citizen of Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation, will lead the research team.</p>

<p>Other recipients of Tier 2 funding from the September 15, 2017, intake include Raven Recycling, Northern Cultural Expressions Society, and Dawson City Football/Minor Soccer. Combined, the 10 organizations received $486,140 through the fund, which will provide more than 8,550 hours of employment for approximately 60 people.</p>

<p>The fund supports projects based upon merit and their ability to provide long-term social, cultural and economic benefits to Yukon communities.</p>

<p>The Community Midwifery Association Yukon is thrilled to be receiving funding from the Department of Economic Development and honoured to embark on this historic endeavour. The project will have social and cultural benefits for Yukon communities. It will create connections to past birthing culture and provide an understanding of traditional birth attendants and their methods. It is important to honour these indigenous roots and learn from them. The transition into motherhood can be the most important time in a woman’s life. It can have lasting effects on all of society.</p>

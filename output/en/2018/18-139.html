<p><em>Joint news release with the Government of Canada</em><br><br>
	Residents of Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and northern British Columbia will be able to connect more reliably with friends and family across Canada and around the world, participate in distance education, seize new business opportunities and search for jobs online. This is made possible thanks to investments in high-speed internet worth up to $79 million by the Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon and <a href="http://nwtel.ca/">Northwestel</a>.</p>

<p>The project will benefit communities, including 63 Indigenous communities, in Yukon, Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and northern British Columbia. Funding was announced today by the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, together with the Honourable Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon and the Honourable Ranj Pillai, Yukon Minister of Economic Development.</p>

<p>Funding will be used to build a 777-kilometre-long fibre network between Dawson City, Yukon, and Inuvik, Northwest Territories. This new fibre network line will also help close the 4,000-kilometre-long Canada North Fibre Loop to ensure a more robust internet service in northern communities. Currently, a cut to the existing fibre network can affect internet service to hospitals and debit and credit machines in retail stores. Construction of this new line will significantly reduce the risk of internet service interruptions throughout this vast region.</p>

<p>Funding is being provided by the following partners:</p>

<ul>
<li>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada is investing up to $30 million through <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/119.nsf/eng/home">Connect to Innovate</a>, a federal program that helps provide Canadians in rural and remote regions of the country with internet access, allowing them to participate fully in the digital economy.</li>
	<li>Infrastructure Canada will invest up to $29 million through the <a href="http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/sc-cp-eng.html">Small Communities Fund</a>.</li>
	<li>The Government of Yukon will invest up to $5 million.</li>
	<li>Northwestel will invest up to $15 million.<br>
		 </li>
</ul>
<p>The federal funding aligns with the Government’s <a href="https://www.budget.gc.ca/2017/docs/bb/brief-bref-en.html">Innovation and Skills Plan</a>, a multi-year strategy to create well-paying jobs and ensure Canadians have the skills to succeed.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada’s $500-million Connect to Innovate program is investing in building the digital backbone of high-speed internet networks. Backbone networks are the digital highways that move data in and out of communities. These highways carry large amounts of data that are essential for schools, hospitals, libraries and businesses to function in a digital world.</p>

<p>Access to high-speed internet is not a luxury; it’s essential. High-speed internet service is a basic tool that all Canadians should have access to, regardless of where they live. Our communities need this service to do business, upgrade their education and build stronger communities. Thanks to our Connect to Innovate program, more people will be able to participate fully in the digital economy.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada’s ongoing investments in broadband infrastructure are improving connectivity in remote communities across the country.

<p>Reliable telecommunications are vital to diversifying our economy and will help Yukoners and northern residents participate fully in the digital economy. Stable internet can also attract increased investment in the territory, creating jobs and other opportunities. Most of all, dependable high-speed internet can open up new economic and social possibilities for Yukoners and support healthy, vibrant and sustainable communities.</p>

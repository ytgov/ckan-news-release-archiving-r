<p>School Council seats are still open at some Yukon schools and the Government of Yukon is encouraging community members to get involved.</p>

<p>School Councils are responsible for providing input on school growth planning, school-based policies, hiring of the school principal and spending of the school budget. They provide advice on school staffing needs, programming, renovations, course offerings and student transportation.</p>

<p>To join a School Council, eligible candidates are typically nominated to participate in a School Council election, held every two years in the spring. The most recent School Council election took place on May 7, 2018.</p>

<p>Citizens who are interested in joining their local School Council but did not participate in the election process can still join. School Councils can nominate eligible individuals to be appointed to the council by the Minister of Education. For School Councils with guaranteed representatives from local First Nations, individuals are nominated by the respective First Nation to occupy these positions.</p>

<p>Contact your local School Council or First Nation for more information. You can also contact the Department of Education at 867-667-5141.</p>

<p>School Councils are a great way for community members to get involved in supporting children’s education. They are an important part of ensuring the community has a say in decisions that affect our schools and learning outcomes for students. I encourage anyone interested in playing a more active part in education and school culture to get involved. Your school community needs you!</p>

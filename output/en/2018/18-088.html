<p>The Government of Yukon, in partnerships with Yukon First Nations, installed three new solar energy generating systems in the territory. The renewable systems are installed on buildings owned by Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, White River First Nation and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, and are capable of generating a total of over 76 kilowatts of electricity.</p>

<p>The federal government’s Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Electricity (REACHE) program provided over $169,000 in funding for the three projects.</p>

<p>Renewable energy projects help reduce Yukon’s reliance on non-renewable sources such as diesel, lessen energy consumption and help transition the territory towards a sustainable and self-reliant energy supply.<br>

<h3>Quotes</h3>

<p>"Our government is pleased to be working with Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, White River First Nation and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in to develop local, renewable and clean energy technologies. These projects help diversify Yukon’s energy supply, reduce our dependence on diesel and encourage Yukoners to become part of the energy supply solution. Thanks to this important federal, territorial and community partnership, our communities are taking advantage of the environmental, social and economic benefits offered by renewable energy."</p>

<p><strong>The Honourable Ranj Pillai, Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources</strong><br>
	 </p>

<p>"Affordable, reliable energy sources are essential to the development of healthier, more sustainable Indigenous and northern communities. The Government of Canada is proud to work in partnership with the Yukon government on innovative renewable energy projects led by the First Nations of Champagne and Aishihik, White River, and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in. It’s through this kind of partnership and cooperation we ensure we are addressing the priorities of First Nations communities as determined by the community."</p>

<p><strong>The Honourable Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs</strong><br>
	 </p>

<p>"Helping remote communities reduce their reliance on diesel fuel and switch to solar power improves air quality, cuts carbon pollution and ensures access to cleaner, more affordable electricity. Working with Indigenous communities and the Yukon government to develop local renewable energy projects is an important part of Canada’s clean growth and climate action plan. The environment and the economy go together – that’s why we’re investing in practical climate solutions that support a more sustainable way of life for people in the North, and a better future for our kids and grandkids."</p>

<p><strong>The Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change</strong><br>
	 </p>

<p>"Champagne and Aishihik First Nations government and staff are excited to have our new solar energy system installed and producing power at our main office in Dakwäkäda (Haines Junction). This project is in close keeping with our values to protect, respect and sustain the environment, while also building on our priorities of good government and self-reliance."</p>

<p><strong>Dän nätthe ada Kaaxnox - Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Chief Steve Smith</strong><br>
	 </p>

<p>"I'm very excited for Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in, this is a first step for renewable energy. I've always had a passion for global climate concerns and appreciate the government’s priority to reduce greenhouse gases. Caring for the environment is everyone’s responsibility. The Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in are pleased to be reducing our carbon footprint by producing clean energy and are grateful for the support and partnerships that made this project possible. This small action will only expand from here on in."</p>

<p><strong>Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph</strong><br>
	 </p>

<p>"White River First Nation is pleased to announce the completion of the new solar panel system on our administration building. This initiative builds upon our community commitment to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. We would like to thank the Yukon government’s Energy Branch for their efforts to see this project through to completion."</p>

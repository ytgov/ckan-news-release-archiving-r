<p>The Yukon Association for Community Living has been awarded $10,516 through the Government of Yukon’s Community Development Fund.</p>

<p>The association will use the funding to hire a consultant to research possibilities for community-based economic development. Yukoners with physical or cognitive challenges often face difficulties finding employment – this research will look into the development of opportunities to remove those barriers and contribute to the local economy.</p>

<p>The project will provide 124 hours of employment for the consultant.</p>

<p>In all, 12 organizations – including the Liard First Nation, Dawson City Museum and the Writing With Light Society – were awarded a combined $157,449 from the October 12, 2017, Tier 1 Community Development Fund intake. The projects will provide more than 865 hours of employment for approximately 20 people.</p>

<p>The fund supports projects based upon merit and their ability to provide long-term social, cultural and economic benefits to Yukon communities.</p>

<p>We really appreciate the funding support from the Government of Yukon’s Department of Economic Development. This will allow us to explore community-based ventures that are inclusive and that celebrate diversity. Social enterprise models can range from agricultural projects to new tourism initiatives, so we’re excited to hear about the possible opportunities and passions of rural Yukon communities.</p>
